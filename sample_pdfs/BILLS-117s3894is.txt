section--
            (1) may not require participants to utilize certain 
        strategies or tools, and shall allow participants to select and

pilot program terminates under this section, the Secretary shall submit 
to Congress a report that includes--
            (1) an assessment of the replicability and the costs and 
        benefits of conducting a permanent State, local, Tribal, and 
        territorial government continuous diagnostics and mitigation 
        program as described in subsection (g) of section 2213 of the 
        Homeland Security Act of 2002 (6 U.S.C. 663), as added by 
        section 2 of this Act;
            (2) the extent to which State, local, Tribal, and 
        territorial governments in the pilot program adhere to widely 
        accepted cybersecurity standards and frameworks and the impact 
        that those policies have on potential widespread sub-Federal 
        continuous diagnostics and mitigation integration; and
            (3) an assessment of the cybersecurity readiness of 
        participants in the pilot program established under this 
        section prior to participation in the pilot program as compared 
        to after completion of the pilot program.
