                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the roles and contributions of the teachers of the United 
  States in building and enhancing the civic, cultural, and economic 
                    well-being of the United States.

Whereas education and knowledge are the foundation of the current and future 
        strength of the United States;
Whereas teachers and other education staff have earned and deserve the respect 
        of their students and communities for their selfless dedication to 
        community service and the futures of the children of the United States;
Whereas during these extraordinarily challenging times, teachers and other 
        education staff have stepped up in new ways and new roles to support 
        their communities and their students;
Whereas the purposes of National Teacher Appreciation Week, celebrated from May 
        2, 2022, through May 6, 2022, are--

    (1) to raise public awareness of the unquantifiable contributions of 
teachers; and

    (2) to promote greater respect and understanding for the teaching 
profession; and

Whereas students, schools, communities, and a number of organizations 
        representing educators are recognizing the importance of teachers during 
        National Teacher Appreciation Week: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) thanks the teachers of the United States; and
            (2) promotes the profession of teaching and the 
        contributions of educators during this time of crisis by 
        encouraging students, parents, school administrators, and 
        public officials to recognize National Teacher Appreciation 
        Week.
