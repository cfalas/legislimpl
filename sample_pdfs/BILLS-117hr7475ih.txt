                                 A BILL


 
To amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to provide coverage under 
the Medicaid program for services provided by doulas and midwives, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Mamas First Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) According to the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention, the maternal mortality rate varies drastically for 
        women by race and ethnicity. On average, there are 12.7 deaths 
        per 100,000 live births for White women, 43.5 deaths per 
        100,000 live births for African-American women, 32.5 deaths for 
        American Indian and Alaskan Native women, and 14.4 deaths per 
        100,000 live births for women of other ethnicities. While 
        maternal mortality disparately impacts African-American women 
        and indigenous women, this urgent public health crisis 
        traverses race, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, educational 
        background, and geography.
            (2) United States maternal mortality rates are the highest 
        in the developed world and are increasing rapidly.
            (3) Many of these maternal deaths are likely preventable.
            (4) According to the National Institutes of Health, doula-
        assisted mothers are four times less likely to have a low-
        birth-weight baby, two times less likely to experience a birth 
        complication involving themselves or their baby, and 
        significantly more likely to initiate breastfeeding.
            (5) Midwife-led care is associated with cost savings, 
        decreased rates of intervention, lower cesarean rates, lower 
        preterm birth rates, and healthier outcomes for mothers and 
        babies.
            (6) Midwives may practice in any setting, including the 
        home, community, hospitals, birth centers, clinics, or health 
        units.

SEC. 3. MEDICAID COVERAGE OF SERVICES PROVIDED BY DOULAS AND MIDWIVES.

    (a) In General.--Section 1905 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 
1396d) is amended--

    (b) Requiring Mandatory Coverage Under State Plan.--Section 
1902(a)(10)(A) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396a(a)(10)(A))

        Services determines requires State legislation in order for the 
        respective plan to meet any requirement imposed by amendments 
        made by this section, the respective plan shall not be regarded 
        as failing to comply with the requirements of such title solely 
        on the basis of its failure to meet such an additional 
        requirement before the first day of the first calendar quarter 
        beginning after the close of the first regular session of the 
        State legislature that begins after the date of the enactment 
        of this Act. For purposes of the previous sentence, in the case 
        of a State that has a 2-year legislative session, each year of 
        the session shall be considered to be a separate regular 
        session of the State legislature.
