SEC. 2114. HANDS-ON LEARNING PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Developing a robust, talented, and homegrown workforce, 
        particularly in the fields of STEM, is critical to the success 
        of the United States innovation economy.
            (2) The United States educational system is not producing a 
        sufficient number of workers with the necessary STEM expertise 
        to meet the needs of the United States industry in STEM fields.
            (3) Hands-on and experiential learning opportunities 
        outside of the classroom are critical for student success in 
        STEM subjects and careers, stimulating students' interest, 
        increasing confidence, and creating motivation to pursue a 
        related career.
            (4) Hands-on and experiential learning opportunities can be 
        particularly successful in inspiring interest in students who 
        traditionally have been underrepresented in STEM fields, 
        including girls, students of color, and students from 
        disadvantaged backgrounds.
            (5) An expansion of hands-on and experiential learning 
        programs across the United States would expand the STEM 
        workforce pipeline, developing and training students for 
        careers in STEM fields.
    (b) Definitions.--

SEC. 2217. BIOECONOMY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACT OF 2021.

    (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Bioeconomy 
Research and Development Act of 2021''.
    (b) Findings.--The Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Cellular and molecular processes may be used, mimicked, 
        or redesigned to develop new products, processes, and systems 
        that improve societal well-being, strengthen national security, 
        and contribute to the economy.
            (2) Engineering biology relies on a workforce with a 
        diverse and unique set of skills combining the biological, 
        physical, chemical, and information sciences and engineering.
            (3) Long-term research and development is necessary to 
        create breakthroughs in engineering biology. Such research and 
        development requires government investment, as many of the 
        benefits are too distant or uncertain for industry to support 
        alone.
            (4) Research is necessary to inform evidence-based 
        governance of engineering biology and to support the growth of 
        the engineering biology industry.
            (5) The Federal Government has an obligation to ensure that 
        ethical, legal, environmental, safety, security, and societal 
        implications of its science and technology research and 
        investment follows policies of responsible innovation and 
        fosters public transparency.
            (6) The Federal Government can play an important role by 
        facilitating the development of tools and technologies to 
        further advance engineering biology, including user facilities, 
        by facilitating public-private partnerships, by supporting risk 
        research, and by facilitating the commercial application in the 
        United States of research funded by the Federal Government.
            (7) The United States led the development of the science 
        and engineering techniques that created the field of 
        engineering biology, but due to increasing international 
        competition, the United States is at risk of losing its 
        competitive advantage if it does not strategically invest the 
        necessary resources.
            (8) A National Engineering Biology Initiative can serve to 
        establish new research directions and technology goals, improve 
        interagency coordination and planning processes, drive 
        technology transfer to the private sector, and help ensure 
        optimal returns on the Federal investment.

SEC. 2306. INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Widespread use of standards facilitates technology 
        advancement by defining and establishing common foundations for 
        interoperability, product differentiation, technological 
        innovation, and other value-added services.
            (2) Standards also promote an expanded, more interoperable, 
        and efficient marketplace.
            (3) Global cooperation and coordination on standards for 
        emerging technologies will be critical for having a consistent 
        set of approaches to enable market competition, preclude 
        barriers to trade, and allow innovation to flourish.
            (4) The People's Republic of China's Standardization Reform 
        Plan and Five-Year Plan for Standardization highlight its high-
        level goals to establish China as a standards power by 2020, 
        participate in at least half of all standards drafting and 
        revision efforts in recognized international standards setting 
        organizations, and strengthen China's participation in the 
        governance of international standards setting organizations.
            (5) As emerging technologies develop for global deployment, 
        it is critical that the United States and its allies continue 
        to participate in the development of standards that underpin 
        the technologies themselves, and the future international 
        governance of these technologies.
            (6) The United States position on standardization in 
        emerging technologies will be critical to United States 
        economic competitiveness.
            (7) The National Institute of Standards and Technology is 
        in a unique position to strengthen United States leadership in 
        standards development, particularly for emerging technologies, 
        to ensure continuing United States economic competitiveness and 
        national security.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the principles of openness, transparency, due process, 
        and consensus in the development of international standards are 
        critical;
            (2) voluntary consensus standards, developed through an 
        industry-led process, serve as the cornerstone of the United 
        States standardization system and have become the basis of a 
        sound national economy and the key to global market access;
            (3) strengthening the unique United States public-private 
        partnerships approach to standards development is critical to 
        United States economic competitiveness; and
            (4) the United States Government should ensure cooperation 
        and coordination across Federal agencies to partner with and 
        support private sector stakeholders to continue to shape 
        international dialogues in regard to standards development for 
        emerging technologies.
    (c) Activities and Engagement.--The Secretary of Commerce, acting 
through the Director, and in consultation with the Secretary of Energy 
as relevant, shall--
            (1) build capacity and training opportunities to help 
        create a pipeline of talent and leadership in key standards 
        development positions;
            (2) partner with private sector entities to support 
        strategic engagement and leadership in the development of 
        international standards for digital economy technologies, 
        including partnering with industry to assist private sector 
        partners to develop standards strategies and support engagement 
        and participation in the relevant standards activities; and
            (3) prioritize efforts on standards development for 
        emerging technologies, identify organizations to develop these 
        standards, identify leadership positions of interest to the 
        United States, and identify key contributors for technical and 
        leadership expertise in these areas.

SEC. 2508. OFFICE OF MANUFACTURING AND INDUSTRIAL INNOVATION POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) The general welfare, security, and economic health and 
        stability of the United States require a long-term, 
        substantial, coordinated, and multidisciplinary strategy and 
        implementation of cohesive objectives to remain at the 
        forefront of industrial innovation.
            (2) The large and complex innovative and technological 
        capabilities of global supply chains and manufacturing 
        economies, which influence the course of national and 
        international manufacturing and innovative relevance, require 
        appropriate attention, including long-range inclusive planning 
        and more immediate program development, to encourage and 
        support private manufacturing growth in the United States and 
        participation in the public decision-making process.
            (3) The innovative and manufacturing capabilities of 
        business in the United States, when properly fostered, applied, 
        and supported, can effectively assist in improving the quality 
        of life for people in the United States, in anticipating and 
        addressing emerging international, national, and local 
        problems, and strengthening the international economic 
        engagement and pioneering leadership of the United States.
            (4) Just as Federal funding for science and technology 
        represents an investment in the future, strategically 
        addressing gaps in the innovation pipeline of the United States 
        would--
                    (A) contribute to converting research and 
                development investments into high-value, quality job-
                creating product production and capture domestic and 
                global markets; and
                    (B) strengthen the economic posture of the United 
                States.
            (5) The capabilities of the United States at both the 
        Federal and State levels need enhanced strategic planning and 
        influence over policy formulation for industrial innovation and 
        technology development, as well as a means to ensure an 
        adequate workforce.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--
            (1) Priority goals.--It is the sense of Congress that 
        manufacturing and industrial innovation should include 
        contributing to the following priority goals:
                    (A) Taking concrete national action to rebuild, 
                restore, and expand domestic manufacturing 
                capabilities, skills, and production capacity, 
                including world-class infrastructure.
                    (B) Rebuilding the industrial innovation commons, 
                including common resources, technical knowledge, and

                the only qualified applicant available for the 
                position.
            ``(6) Regulations.--Under the program established under 
        paragraph (2), early retirement and separation pay may be 
        offered only pursuant to regulations established by the 
        Administrator, subject to such limitations or conditions as the 
        Administrator may require.
            ``(7) Use of existing funds.--The Administrator shall carry 
        out this subsection using amounts otherwise made available to 
        the Administrator and no additional funds are authorized to be

SEC. 3002. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The People's Republic of China (PRC) is leveraging its 
        political, diplomatic, economic, military, technological, and 
        ideological power to become a strategic, near-peer, global 
        competitor of the United States. The policies increasingly 
        pursued by the PRC in these domains are contrary to the 
        interests and values of the United States, its partners, and 
        much of the rest of the world.
            (2) The current policies being pursued by the PRC--
                    (A) threaten the future character of the 
                international order and are shaping the rules, norms, 
                and institutions that govern relations among states;
                    (B) will put at risk the ability of the United 
                States to secure its national interests; and
                    (C) will put at risk the future peace, prosperity, 
                and freedom of the international community in the 
                coming decades.
            (3) After normalizing diplomatic relations with the PRC in 
        1979, the United States actively worked to advance the PRC's 
        economic and social development to ensure that the PRC 
        participated in, and benefitted from, the free and open 
        international order. The United States pursued these goals and 
        contributed to the welfare of the Chinese people by--
                    (A) increasing the PRC's trade relations and access 
                to global capital markets;
                    (B) promoting the PRC's accession to the World 
                Trade Organization;
                    (C) providing development finance and technical 
                assistance;
                    (D) promoting research collaboration;
                    (E) educating the PRC's top students;
                    (F) permitting transfers of cutting-edge 
                technologies and scientific knowledge; and
                    (G) providing intelligence and military assistance.
            (4) It is now clear that the PRC has chosen to pursue 
        state-led, mercantilist economic policies, an increasingly 
        authoritarian governance model at home through increased 
        restrictions on personal freedoms, and an aggressive and 
        assertive foreign policy. These policies frequently and 
        deliberately undermine United States interests and are contrary 
        to core United States values and the values of other nations, 
        both in the Indo-Pacific and beyond. In response to this 
        strategic decision of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the 
        United States has been compelled to reexamine and revise its 
        strategy towards the PRC.
            (5) The General Secretary of the CCP and the President of 
        the PRC, Xi Jinping, has elevated the ``Great Rejuvenation of 
        the Chinese Nation'' as central to the domestic and foreign 
        policy of the PRC. His program demands--
                    (A) strong, centralized CCP leadership;
                    (B) concentration of military power;
                    (C) a strong role for the CCP in the state and the 
                economy;
                    (D) an aggressive foreign policy seeking control 
                over broadly asserted territorial claims; and
                    (E) the denial of any values and individual rights 
                that are deemed to threaten the CCP.
            (6) The PRC views its Leninist model of governance, 
        ``socialism with Chinese characteristics'', as superior to, and 
        at odds with, the constitutional models of the United States 
        and other democracies. This approach to governance is lauded by 
        the CCP as essential to securing the PRC's status as a global 
        leader, and to shaping the future of the world. In a 2013 
        speech, President Xi said, ``We firmly believe that as 
        socialism with Chinese characteristics develops further . . . 
        it is . . . inevitable that the superiority of our socialist 
        system will be increasingly apparent . . . [and] our country's 
        road of development will have increasingly greater influence on 
        the world.''.
            (7) The PRC's objectives are to first establish regional 
        hegemony over the Indo-Pacific and then to use that dominant 
        position to propel the PRC to become the ``leading world 
        power,'' shaping an international order that is conducive to 
        the CCP's interests. Achieving these objectives require turning 
        the PRC into a wealthy nation under strict CCP rule and using a 
        strong military and advanced technological capability to pursue 
        the PRC's objectives, regardless of other countries' interests.
            (8) The PRC is reshaping the current international order, 
        which is built upon the rule of law and free and open ideals 
        and principles, by conducting global information and influence 
        operations, seeking to redefine international laws and norms to 
        align with the objectives of the CCP, rejecting the legitimacy 
        of internationally recognized human rights, and seeking to co-
        opt the leadership and agenda of multinational organizations 
        for the benefit of the PRC and other authoritarian regimes at 
        the expense of the interests of the United States and the 
        international community. In December 2018, President Xi 
        suggested that the CCP views its ``historic mission'' as not 
        only to govern China, but also to profoundly influence global 
        governance to benefit the CCP.
            (9) The PRC is encouraging other countries to follow its 
        model of ``socialism with Chinese characteristics''. During the 
        19th Party Congress in 2017, President Xi said that the PRC 
        could serve as a model of development for other countries by 
        utilizing ``Chinese wisdom'' and a ``Chinese approach to 
        solving problems''.
            (10) The PRC is promoting its governance model and 
        attempting to weaken other models of governance by--
                    (A) undermining democratic institutions;
                    (B) subverting financial institutions;
                    (C) coercing businesses to accommodate the policies 
                of the PRC; and
                    (D) using disinformation to disguise the nature of 
                the actions described in subparagraphs (A) through (C).
            (11) The PRC is close to its goal of becoming the global 
        leader in science and technology. In May 2018, President Xi 
        said that for the PRC to reach ``prosperity and rejuvenation'', 
        it needs to ``endeavor to be a major world center for science 
        and innovation''. The PRC has invested the equivalent of 
        billions of dollars into education and research and 
        development, and has established joint scientific research 
        centers and science universities.
            (12) The PRC's drive to become a ``manufacturing and 
        technological superpower'' and to promote ``innovation with 
        Chinese characteristics'' is coming at the expense of human 
        rights and longstanding international rules and norms with 
        respect to economic competition, and presents a challenge to 
        United States national security and the security of allies and 
        like-minded countries. In particular, the PRC advances its 
        illiberal political and social policies through mass 
        surveillance, social credit systems, and a significant role of 
        the state in internet governance. Through these means, the PRC 
        increases direct and indirect government control over its 
        citizens' everyday lives. Its national strategy of ``Military-
        Civil Fusion'' mandates that civil and commercial research, 
        which increasingly drives global innovation, is leveraged to 
        develop new military capabilities.
            (13) The PRC and the CCP are committing crimes against 
        humanity and are engaged in an ongoing genocide, in violation 
        of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime 
        of Genocide, done at Paris December 9, 1948, against the 
        predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious 
        minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, 
        including through campaigns of imprisonment, torture, rape, and 
        coercive birth prevention policies.
            (14) The PRC is using legal and illegal means to achieve 
        its objective of becoming a manufacturing and technological 
        superpower. The PRC uses state-directed industrial policies in 
        anticompetitive ways to ensure the dominance of PRC companies. 
        The CCP engages in and encourages actions that actively 
        undermine a free and open international market, such as 
        intellectual property theft, forced technology transfers, 
        regulatory and financial subsidies, and mandatory CCP access to 
        proprietary data as part of business and commercial agreements 
        between Chinese and foreign companies.
            (15) The policies referred to in paragraph (14) are 
        designed to freeze United States and other foreign firms out of 
        the PRC market, while eroding competition in other important 
        markets. The heavy subsidization of Chinese companies includes 
        potential violation of its World Trade Organization 
        commitments. In May 2018, President Xi said that the PRC aims 
        to keep the ``initiatives of innovation and development 
        security . . . in [China's] own hands''.
            (16) The PRC is advancing its global objectives through a 
        variety of avenues, including its signature initiative, the 
        Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which is enshrined in the 
        Chinese Constitution and includes the Digital Silk Road and 
        Health Silk Road. The PRC describes BRI as a straightforward 
        and wholly beneficial plan for all countries. However, it 
        eventually seeks to advance an economic system with the PRC at 
        its center, making it the most concrete geographical 
        representation of the PRC's global ambitions. BRI increases the 
        economic influence of state-owned Chinese firms in global 
        markets, enhances the PRC's political leverage with government 
        leaders around the world, and provides greater access to 
        strategic nodes such as ports and railways. Through BRI, the 
        PRC seeks political deference through economic dependence.
            (17) The PRC is executing a plan to establish regional 
        hegemony over the Indo-Pacific and displace the United States 
        from the region. As a Pacific power, the United States has 
        built and supported enduring alliances and economic 
        partnerships that secure peace and prosperity and promote the 
        rule of law and political pluralism in a free and open Indo-
        Pacific. In contrast, the PRC uses economic and military 
        coercion in the region to secure its own interests.
            (18) The PRC's military strategy seeks to keep the United 
        States military from operating in the Western Pacific and to 
        erode United States security guarantees.
            (19) The PRC is aggressively pursuing exclusive control of 
        critical land routes, sea lanes, and air space in the Indo-
        Pacific in the hopes of eventually exercising greater influence 
        beyond the region. This includes lanes crucial to commercial 
        activity, energy exploration, transport, and the exercise of 
        security operations in areas permitted under international law.
            (20) The PRC seeks so-called ``reunification'' with Taiwan 
        through whatever means may ultimately be required. The CCP's 
        insistence that so-called ``reunification'' is Taiwan's only 
        option makes this goal inherently coercive. In January 2019, 
        President Xi stated that the PRC ``make[s] no promise to 
        renounce the use of force and reserve[s] the option of taking 
        all necessary means''. Taiwan's embodiment of democratic values 
        and economic liberalism challenges President Xi's goal of 
        achieving national rejuvenation. The PRC plans to exploit 
        Taiwan's dominant strategic position in the First Island Chain 
        and to project power into the Second Island Chain and beyond.
            (21) In the South China Sea, the PRC has executed an 
        illegal island-building campaign that threatens freedom of 
        navigation and the free-flow of commerce, damages the 
        environment, bolsters PLA power projection capabilities, and 
        coerces and intimidates other regional claimants in an effort 
        to advance its unlawful claims and control the waters around 
        neighboring countries. Despite President Xi's September 2015 
        speech, in which he said the PRC did not intend to militarize 
        the South China Sea, during the 2017 19th Party Congress, 
        President Xi announced that ``construction on islands and reefs 
        in the South China Sea have seen steady progress''.
            (22) The PRC is rapidly modernizing the PLA to attain a 
        level of capacity and capability superior to the United States 
        in terms of equipment and conduct of modern military operations 
        by shifting its military doctrine from having a force 
        ``adequate [for] China's defensive needs'' to having a force 
        ``commensurate with China's international status''. Ultimately, 
        this transformation could enable China to impose its will in 
        the Indo-Pacific region through the threat of military force. 
        In 2017, President Xi established the following developmental 
        benchmarks for the advancement of the PLA:
                    (A) A mechanized force with increased informatized 
                and strategic capabilities by 2020.
                    (B) The complete modernization of China's national 
                defense by 2035.
                    (C) The full transformation of the PLA into a 
                world-class force by 2050.
            (23) The PRC's strategy and supporting policies described 
        in this section undermine United States interests, such as--
                    (A) upholding a free and open international order;
                    (B) maintaining the integrity of international 
                institutions with liberal norms and values;
                    (C) preserving a favorable balance of power in the 
                Indo-Pacific;
                    (D) ensuring the defense of its allies;
                    (E) preserving open sea and air lanes;
                    (F) fostering the free flow of commerce through 
                open and transparent markets; and
                    (G) promoting individual freedom and human rights.
            (24) The global COVID-19 pandemic has intensified and 
        accelerated these trends in the PRC's behavior and therefore 
        increased the need for United States global leadership and a 
        competitive posture. The PRC has capitalized on the world's 
        focus on the COVID-19 pandemic by--
                    (A) moving rapidly to undermine Hong Kong's 
                autonomy, including imposing a so-called ``national 
                security law'' on Hong Kong;
                    (B) aggressively imposing its will in the East and 
                South China Seas;
                    (C) contributing to increased tensions with India; 
                and
                    (D) engaging in a widespread and government-
                directed disinformation campaign to obscure the PRC 
                government's efforts to cover up the seriousness of 
                COVID-19, sow confusion about the origination of the 
                outbreak, and discredit the United States, its allies, 
                and global health efforts.
            (25) The CCP's disinformation campaign referred to in 
        paragraph (24)(D) has included--
                    (A) concerted efforts, in the early days of the 
                pandemic, to downplay the nature and scope of the 
                outbreak in Wuhan in the PRC, as well as cases of 
                person-to-person transmission;
                    (B) claims that the virus originated in United 
                States biological defense research at Fort Detrick, 
                Maryland;
                    (C) Chinese state media reports insinuating a 
                possible link between the virus and other United States 
                biological facilities; and
                    (D) efforts to block access to qualified 
                international infectious disease experts who might 
                contradict the CCP's narrative.
            (26) In response to the PRC's strategy and policies, the 
        United States must adopt a policy of strategic competition with 
        the PRC to protect and promote our vital interests and values.
            (27) The United States' policy of strategic competition 
        with respect to the PRC is part of a broader strategic approach 
        to the Indo-Pacific and the world which centers around 
        cooperation with United States allies and partners to advance 
        shared values and interests and to preserve and enhance a free, 
        open, democratic, inclusive, rules-based, stable, and diverse 
        region.
            (28) The Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (Public 
        Law 115-409) contributed to a comprehensive framework for 
        promoting United State security interests, economic interests, 
        and values in the Indo-Pacific region, investing $7,500,000,000 
        over 5 years--
                    (A) to support greater security and defense 
                cooperation between the United States and allies and 
                partners in the Indo-Pacific region;
                    (B) to advance democracy and the protection and 
                promotion of human rights in the Indo-Pacific region;
                    (C) to enhance cybersecurity cooperation between 
                the United States and partners in the Indo-Pacific;
                    (D) to deepen people-to-people engagement through 
                programs such as the Young Southeast Asian Leaders

SEC. 3004. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    (a) Objectives.--It is the policy of the United States, in pursuing 
strategic competition with the PRC, to pursue the following objectives:
            (1) The United States global leadership role is sustained 
        and its political system and major foundations of national 
        power are postured for long-term political, economic, 
        technological, and military competition with the PRC.
            (2) The balance of power in the Indo-Pacific remains 
        favorable to the United States and its allies. The United 
        States and its allies maintain unfettered access to the region, 
        including through freedom of navigation and the free flow of 
        commerce, consistent with international law and practice, and 
        the PRC neither dominates the region nor coerces its neighbors.
            (3) The allies and partners of the United States--
                    (A) maintain confidence in United States leadership 
                and its commitment to the Indo-Pacific region;
                    (B) can withstand and combat subversion and undue 
                influence by the PRC; and
                    (C) align themselves with the United States in 
                setting global rules, norms, and standards that benefit 
                the international community.
            (4) The combined weight of the United States and its allies 
        and partners is strong enough to demonstrate to the PRC that 
        the risks of attempts to dominate other states outweigh the 
        potential benefits.
            (5) The United States leads the free and open international 
        order, which is comprised of resilient states and institutions 
        that uphold and defend principles, such as sovereignty, rule of 
        law, individual freedom, and human rights. The international 
        order is strengthened to defeat attempts at destabilization by 
        illiberal and authoritarian actors.
            (6) The key rules, norms, and standards of international 
        engagement in the 21st century are maintained, including--
                    (A) the protection of human rights, commercial 
                engagement and investment, and technology; and
                    (B) that such rules, norms, and standards are in 
                alignment with the values and interests of the United 
                States, its allies and partners, and the free world.
            (7) The United States assures that the CCP does not--
                    (A) subvert open and democratic societies;
                    (B) distort global markets;
                    (C) manipulate the international trade system;
                    (D) coerce other nations via economic and military 
                means; or
                    (E) use its technological advantages to undermine 
                individual freedoms or other states' national security 
                interests.
            (8) The United States deters military confrontation with 
        the PRC and both nations work to reduce the risk of conflict.
    (b) Policy.--It is the policy of the United States, in pursuit of 
the objectives set forth in subsection (a)--
            (1) to strengthen the United States domestic foundation by 
        reinvesting in market-based economic growth, education, 
        scientific and technological innovation, democratic 
        institutions, and other areas that improve the ability of the 
        United States to pursue its vital economic, foreign policy, and 
        national security interests;
            (2) to pursue a strategy of strategic competition with the 
        PRC in the political, diplomatic, economic, development, 
        military, informational, and technological realms that 
        maximizes the United States' strengths and increases the costs 
        for the PRC of harming United States interests and the values 
        of United States allies and partners;
            (3) to lead a free, open, and secure international system 
        characterized by freedom from coercion, rule of law, open 
        markets and the free flow of commerce, and a shared commitment 
        to security and peaceful resolution of disputes, human rights, 
        and good and transparent governance;
            (4) to strengthen and deepen United States alliances and 
        partnerships, prioritizing the Indo-Pacific and Europe, by 
        pursuing greater bilateral and multilateral cooperative 
        initiatives that advance shared interests and values and 
        bolster partner countries' confidence that the United States is 
        and will remain a strong, committed, and constant partner;
            (5) to encourage and collaborate with United States allies 
        and partners in boosting their own capabilities and resiliency 
        to pursue, defend, and protect shared interests and values, 
        free from coercion and external pressure;
            (6) to pursue fair, reciprocal treatment and healthy 
        competition in United States-China economic relations by--
                    (A) advancing policies that harden the United 
                States economy against unfair and illegal commercial or 
                trading practices and the coercion of United States 
                businesses; and
                    (B) tightening United States laws and regulations 
                as necessary to prevent the PRC's attempts to harm 
                United States economic competitiveness;
            (7) to demonstrate the value of private sector-led growth 
        in emerging markets around the world, including through the use 
        of United States Government tools that--
                    (A) support greater private sector investment and 
                advance capacity-building initiatives that are grounded 
                in the rule of law;
                    (B) promote open markets;
                    (C) establish clear policy and regulatory 
                frameworks;
                    (D) improve the management of key economic sectors;
                    (E) combat corruption; and
                    (F) foster and support greater collaboration with 
                and among partner countries and the United States 
                private sector to develop secure and sustainable 
                infrastructure;
            (8) to lead in the advancement of international rules and 
        norms that foster free and reciprocal trade and open and 
        integrated markets;
            (9) to conduct vigorous commercial diplomacy in support of 
        United States companies and businesses in partner countries 
        that seek fair competition;
            (10) to ensure that the United States leads in the 
        innovation of critical and emerging technologies, such as next-
        generation telecommunications, artificial intelligence, quantum 
        computing, semiconductors, and biotechnology, by--
                    (A) providing necessary investment and concrete 
                incentives for the private sector to accelerate 
                development of such technologies;
                    (B) modernizing export controls and investment 
                screening regimes and associated policies and 
                regulations;
                    (C) enhancing United States leadership in technical 
                standards-setting bodies and avenues for developing 
                norms regarding the use of emerging critical 
                technologies;
                    (D) reducing United States barriers and increasing 
                incentives for collaboration with allies and partners 
                on the research and co-development of critical 
                technologies;
                    (E) collaborating with allies and partners to

        posed by undue influence of the CCP in the United States;
            (12) to implement measures to mitigate the risks referred 
        to in paragraph (11), while still preserving opportunities for 
        economic engagement, academic research, and cooperation in

SEC. 3005. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the execution of the policy 
described in section 3004(b) requires the following actions:
            (1) Strategic competition with the PRC will require the 
        United States--
                    (A) to marshal sustained political will to protect 
                its vital interests, promote its values, and advance 
                its economic and national security objectives for 
                decades to come; and
                    (B) to achieve this sustained political will, 
                persuade the American people and United States allies 
                and partners of--
                            (i) the challenges posed by the PRC; and
                            (ii) the need for long-term competition to 
                        defend shared interests and values.
            (2) The United States must coordinate closely with allies 
        and partners to compete effectively with the PRC, including to 
        encourage allies and partners to assume, as appropriate, 
        greater roles in balancing and checking the aggressive and 
        assertive behavior of the PRC.
            (3) The President of the United States must lead and direct 
        the entire executive branch to treat the People's Republic of 
        China as the greatest geopolitical and geoeconomic challenge 
        for United States foreign policy, increasing the prioritization 
        of strategic competition with the PRC and broader United States 
        interests in the Indo-Pacific region in the conduct of foreign 
        policy and assuring the allocation of appropriate resources 
        adequate to the challenge.
            (4) The head of every Federal department and agency should 
        designate a senior official at the level of Under Secretary or 
        above to coordinate the department's or agency's policies with 
        respect to strategic competition with the PRC.
            (5) The ability of the United States to execute a strategy 
        of strategic competition with the PRC will be undermined if our 
        attention is repeatedly diverted to challenges that are not 
        vital to United States economic and national security 
        interests.
            (6) In the coming decades, the United States must prevent 
        the PRC from--
                    (A) establishing regional hegemony in the Indo-
                Pacific; and
                    (B) using that position to advance its assertive 
                political, economic, and foreign policy goals around 
                the world.
            (7) The United States must ensure that the Federal budget 
        is properly aligned with the strategic imperative to compete 
        with the PRC by--
                    (A) ensuring sufficient levels of funding to 
                resource all instruments of United States national 
                power; and
                    (B) coherently prioritizing how such funds are 
                used.
            (8) Sustained prioritization of the challenge posed by the 
        PRC requires--
                    (A) bipartisan cooperation within Congress; and
                    (B) frequent, sustained, and meaningful 
                collaboration and consultation between the executive 
                branch and Congress.
            (9) The United States must ensure close integration among 
        economic and foreign policymakers, the private sector, civil 
        society, universities and academic institutions, and other 
        relevant actors in free and open societies affected by the 
        challenges posed by the PRC to enable such actors--
                    (A) to collaborate to advance common interests; and
                    (B) to identify appropriate policies--
                            (i) to strengthen the United States and its 
                        allies;
                            (ii) to promote a compelling vision of a 
                        free and open order; and
                            (iii) to push back against detrimental 
                        policies pursued by the CCP.
            (10) The United States must ensure that all Federal 
        departments and agencies are organized to reflect the fact that 
        strategic competition with the PRC is the United States' 
        greatest geopolitical and geoeconomic challenge, including 
        through the assigned missions and location of United States 
        Government personnel, by--
                    (A) dedicating more personnel in the Indo-Pacific 
                region, at posts around the world, and in Washington 
                DC, with priorities directly relevant to advancing 
                competition with the People's Republic of China;
                    (B) placing greater numbers of foreign service 
                officers, international development professionals, 
                members of the foreign commercial service, intelligence 
                professionals, and other United States Government 
                personnel in the Indo-Pacific region; and
                    (C) ensuring that this workforce, both civilian and 
                military, has the training in language, technical 
                skills, and other competencies required to advance a 
                successful competitive strategy with the PRC.
            (11) The United States must place renewed emphasis on 
        strengthening the nonmilitary instruments of national power, 
        including diplomacy, information, technology, economics, 
        foreign assistance and development finance, commerce, 
        intelligence, and law enforcement, which are crucial for 
        addressing the unique economic, political, and ideological 
        challenges posed by the PRC.
            (12) The United States must sustain resourcing for a 
        Pacific Deterrence Initiative, which shall be aligned with the 
        overarching political and diplomatic objectives articulated in 
        the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act (Public Law 115-409), and 
        must prioritize the military investments necessary to achieve 
        United States political objectives in the Indo-Pacific, 
        including--
                    (A) promoting regional security in the Indo-
                Pacific;
                    (B) reassuring allies and partners while protecting 
                them from coercion; and
                    (C) deterring conflict with the PRC.
            (13) Competition with the PRC requires the United States' 
        skillful adaptation to the information environment of the 21st 
        century. United States public diplomacy and messaging efforts 
        must effectively--
                    (A) promote the value of partnership with the 
                United States;
                    (B) highlight the risks and costs of enmeshment

State, the Department of Commerce, the Department of the Treasury, the 
Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, the United 
States Agency for International Development, the United States Trade 
and Development Agency, the Development Finance Corporation, the 
Export-Import Bank of the United States, and other agencies to catalyze 
private sector investments around the world and to coordinate the 
deployment of United States Government technical assistance and 
development finance tools, including project preparation services and 
commercial advocacy.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the world's infrastructure needs, including in the 
        transport, energy, and digital sectors, are vast and growing;
            (2) total or partial ownership or acquisition of, or a 
        significant financial stake or physical presence in, certain 
        types of infrastructure, including ports, energy grids, 5G 
        telecommunications networks, and undersea cables, can provide 
        an advantage to countries that do not share the interests and 
        values of the United States and its allies and partners, and 
        could therefore be deleterious to the interests and values of 
        the United States and its allies and partners;
            (3) the United States must continue to prioritize support 
        for infrastructure projects that are physically secure, 
        financially viable, economically sustainable, and socially 
        responsible;
            (4) achieving the objective outlined in paragraph (3)

        economic tools across the interagency, so that such tools are 
        deployed in a way to maximize United States interests and that 
        of its allies and partners;
            (5) the GICC represents an important and concrete step 
        towards better communication and coordination across the United 
        States Government of economic tools relevant to supporting 
        infrastructure that is physically secure, financially viable, 
        economically sustainable, and socially responsible, and should 
        be continued; and
            (6) the executive branch and Congress should have 
        consistent consultations on United States support for strategic 
        infrastructure projects, including how Congress can support 
        such initiatives in the future.

SEC. 3132. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR COUNTERING CHINESE 
              INFLUENCE FUND.

    (a) Countering Chinese Influence Fund.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated $300,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026

pursuant to this authorization are authorized to remain available until 
expended and shall be in addition to amounts otherwise authorized to be 
appropriated to counter such influence.
    (b) Consultation Required.--The obligation of funds appropriated or 
otherwise made available to counter the malign influence of the Chinese 
Communist Party globally shall be subject to prior consultation with, 
and consistent with section 634A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 
(22 U.S.C. 2394-1), the regular notification procedures of--
            (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the Senate; and
            (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the House of Representatives.
    (c) Policy Guidance, Coordination, and Approval.--
            (1) Coordinator.--The Secretary of State shall designate an 
        existing senior official of the Department at the rank of 
        Assistant Secretary or above to provide policy guidance, 
        coordination, and approval for the obligation of funds 
        authorized pursuant to subsection (a).
            (2) Duties.--The senior official designated pursuant to 
        paragraph (1) shall be responsible for--
                    (A) on an annual basis, the identification of 
                specific strategic priorities for using the funds 
                authorized to be appropriated by subsection (a), such 
                as geographic areas of focus or functional categories 
                of programming that funds are to be concentrated 
                within, consistent with the national interests of the 
                United States and the purposes of this division;
                    (B) the coordination and approval of all 
                programming conducted using the funds authorized to be 
                appropriated by subsection (a), based on a 
                determination that such programming directly counters 
                the malign influence of the Chinese Communist Party, 
                including specific activities or policies advanced by 
                the Chinese Communist Party, pursuant to the strategic 
                objectives of the United States, as established in the 
                2017 National Security Strategy, the 2018 National 
                Defense Strategy, and other relevant national and 
                regional strategies as appropriate;
                    (C) ensuring that all programming approved bears a 
                sufficiently direct nexus to such acts by the Chinese 
                Communist Party described in subsection (d) and adheres 
                to the requirements outlined in subsection (e); and
                    (D) conducting oversight, monitoring, and 
                evaluation of the effectiveness of all programming 
                conducted using the funds authorized to be appropriated 
                by subsection (a) to ensure that it advances United 
                States interests and degrades the ability of the 
                Chinese Communist Party, to advance activities that 
                align with subsection (d) of this section.
            (3) Interagency coordination.--The senior official 
        designated pursuant to paragraph (1) shall, in coordinating and

                    (A) conduct appropriate interagency consultation; 
                and
                    (B) ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that 
                all approved programming functions in concert with 
                other Federal activities to counter the malign 
                influence and activities of the Chinese Communist 
                Party.
            (4) Assistant coordinator.--The Administrator of the United 
        States Agency for International Development shall designate a 
        senior official at the rank of Assistant Administrator or above 
        to assist and consult with the senior official designated 
        pursuant to paragraph (1).
    (d) Malign Influence.--In this section, the term ``malign 
influence'' with respect to the Chinese Communist Party should be 
construed to include acts conducted by the Chinese Communist Party or 
entities acting on its behalf that--
            (1) undermine a free and open international order;
            (2) advance an alternative, repressive international order 
        that bolsters the Chinese Communist Party's hegemonic ambitions 
        and is characterized by coercion and dependency;
            (3) undermine the national security or sovereignty of the 
        United States or other countries; or
            (4) undermine the economic security of the United States or 
        other countries, including by promoting corruption.
    (e) Countering Malign Influence.--In this section, countering 
malign influence through the use of funds authorized to be appropriated

        malign influence of the Chinese Communist Party;
            (2) support civil society and independent media to raise 
        awareness of and increase transparency regarding the negative

        or benefit from, the malign influence of the Chinese Communist 
        Party;
            (4) encourage economic development structures that help 
        protect against predatory lending schemes, including support

            (5) counter activities that provide undue influence to the 
        security forces of the People's Republic of China;
            (6) expose misinformation and disinformation of the Chinese 
        Communist Party's propaganda, including through programs 
        carried out by the Global Engagement Center; and

SEC. 3133. FINDINGS ON CHINESE INFORMATION WARFARE AND MALIGN INFLUENCE 
              OPERATIONS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In the report to Congress required under section 
        1261(b) of the John S. McCain National Defense Authorization 
        Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public Law 115-232), the President 
        laid out a broad range of malign activities conducted by the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China and its agents and 
        entities, including--
                    (A) propaganda and disinformation, in which 
                ``Beijing communicates its narrative through state-run 
                television, print, radio, and online organizations 
                whose presence is proliferating in the United States 
                and around the world'';
                    (B) malign political influence operations, 
                particularly ``front organizations and agents which 
                target businesses, universities, think tanks, scholars, 
                journalists, and local state and Federal officials in 
                the United States and around the world, attempting to 
                influence discourse''; and
                    (C) malign financial influence operations, 
                characterized as the ``misappropriation of technology 
                and intellectual property, failure to appropriately 
                disclose relationships with foreign government 
                sponsored entities, breaches of contract and 
                confidentiality, and manipulation of processes for fair 
                and merit-based allocation of Federal research and 
                development funding''.
            (2) Chinese information warfare and malign influence 
        operations are ongoing. In January 2019, then-Director of 
        National Intelligence, Dan Coats, stated, ``China will continue 
        to use legal, political, and economic levers--such as the lure 
        of Chinese markets--to shape the information environment. It is 
        also capable of using cyber attacks against systems in the 
        United States to censor or suppress viewpoints it deems 
        politically sensitive.''.
            (3) In February 2020, then-Director of the Federal Bureau 
        of Investigation, Christopher Wray, testified to the Committee 
        on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives that the 
        People's Republic of China has ``very active [malign] foreign 
        influence efforts in this country,'' with the goal of ``trying 
        to shift our policy and our public opinion to be more pro-China 
        on a variety of issues''.
            (4) The PRC's information warfare and malign influence 
        operations continue to adopt new tactics and evolve in 
        sophistication. In May 2020, then-Special Envoy and Coordinator 
        of the Global Engagement Center (GEC), Lea Gabrielle, stated 
        that there was a convergence of Russian and Chinese narratives 
        surrounding COVID-19 and that the GEC had ``uncovered a new 
        network of inauthentic Twitter accounts'' that it assessed was 
        ``created with the intent to amplify Chinese propaganda and 
        disinformation''. In June 2020, Google reported that Chinese 
        hackers attempted to access email accounts of the campaign 
        staff of a presidential candidate.
            (5) Chinese information warfare and malign influence 
        operations are a threat to the national security, democracy, 
        and economic systems of the United States and its allies and 
        partners. In October 2018, Vice President Michael R. Pence 
        warned that ``Beijing is employing a whole-of-government 
        approach, using political, economic, and military tools, as 
        well as propaganda, to advance its influence and benefit its 
        interests in the United States.''.
            (6) In February 2018, then-Director of the Federal Bureau 
        of Investigation, Christopher Wray, testified to the Select 
        Committee on Intelligence of the Senate that the People's 
        Republic of China is taking advantage of and exploiting the 
        open research and development environments of United States 
        institutions of higher education to utilize ``professors, 
        scientists and students'' as ``nontraditional collectors'' of 
        information.
    (b) Presidential Duties.--The President shall--
            (1) protect our democratic institutions and processes from 
        malign influence from the People's Republic of China and other 
        foreign adversaries; and
            (2) consistent with the policy specified in paragraph (1), 
        direct the heads of the appropriate Federal departments and 
        agencies to implement Acts of Congress to counter and deter PRC 
        and other foreign information warfare and malign influence 
        operations without delay, including--
                    (A) section 1043 of the John S. McCain National 
                Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019 (Public 
                Law 115-232), which authorizes a coordinator position 
                within the National Security Council for countering 
                malign foreign influence operations and campaigns;
                    (B) section 228 of the National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2020 (Public Law 116-
                92), which authorizes additional research of foreign 
                malign influence operations on social media platforms;
                    (C) section 847 of such Act, which requires the 
                Secretary of Defense to modify contracting regulations 
                regarding vetting for foreign ownership, control and 
                influence in order to mitigate risks from malign 
                foreign influence;
                    (D) section 1239 of such Act, which requires an 
                update of the comprehensive strategy to counter the 
                threat of malign influence to include the People's 
                Republic of China;
                    (E) section 5323 of such Act, which authorizes the 
                Director of National Intelligence to facilitate the 
                establishment of Social Media Data and Threat Analysis 
                Center to detect and study information warfare and 
                malign influence operations across social media 
                platforms; and
                    (F) section 119C of the National Security Act of 
                1947 (50 U.S.C. 3059), which authorizes the 
                establishment of a Foreign Malign Influence Response 
                Center inside the Office of the Director of National 
                Intelligence.

SEC. 3134. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FULBRIGHT-HAYS 
              PROGRAM.

    There are authorized to be appropriated, for the 5-year period 
beginning on October 1, 2021, $105,500,000, to promote education, 
training, research, and foreign language skills through the Fulbright-
Hays Program, in accordance with section 102(b) of the Mutual 
Educational and Cultural Exchange Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2452(b)).

SEC. 3135. SENSE OF CONGRESS CONDEMNING ANTI-ASIAN RACISM AND 
              DISCRIMINATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, crimes and 
        discrimination against Asians and those of Asian descent have 
        risen dramatically worldwide. In May 2020, United Nations 
        Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said ``the pandemic 
        continues to unleash a tsunami of hate and xenophobia, 
        scapegoating and scare-mongering'' and urged governments to 
        ``act now to strengthen the immunity of our societies against 
        the virus of hate''.
            (2) Asian American and Pacific Island (AAPI) workers make 
        up a large portion of the essential workers on the frontlines 
        of the COVID-19 pandemic, making up 8.5 percent of all 
        essential healthcare workers in the United States. AAPI workers 
        also make up a large share--between 6 percent and 12 percent 
        based on sector--of the biomedical field.
            (3) The United States Census notes that Americans of Asian 
        descent alone made up nearly 5.9 percent of the United States 
        population in 2019, and that Asian Americans are the fastest-
        growing racial group in the United States, projected to 
        represent 14 percent of the United States population by 2065.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the reprehensible attacks on people of Asian descent 
        and concerning increase in anti-Asian sentiment and racism in 
        the United States and around the world have no place in a 
        peaceful, civilized, and tolerant world;
            (2) the United States is a diverse nation with a proud 
        tradition of immigration, and the strength and vibrancy of the 
        United States is enhanced by the diverse ethnic backgrounds and 
        tolerance of its citizens, including Asian Americans and 
        Pacific Islanders;
            (3) the United States Government should encourage other 
        foreign governments to use the official and scientific names 
        for the COVID-19 pandemic, as recommended by the World Health 
        Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and 
        Prevention; and
            (4) the United States Government and other governments 
        around the world must actively oppose racism and intolerance, 
        and use all available and appropriate tools to combat the 
        spread of anti-Asian racism and discrimination.

SEC. 3136. SUPPORTING INDEPENDENT MEDIA AND COUNTERING DISINFORMATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The PRC is increasing its spending on public diplomacy 
        including influence campaigns, advertising, and investments 
        into state-sponsored media publications outside of the PRC. 
        These include, for example, more than $10,000,000,000 in 
        foreign direct investment in communications infrastructure, 
        platforms, and properties, as well as bringing journalists to 
        the PRC for training programs.
            (2) The PRC, through the Voice of China, the United Front 
        Work Department (UFWD), and UFWD's many affiliates and proxies, 
        has obtained unfettered access to radio, television, and 
        digital dissemination platforms in numerous languages targeted 
        at citizens in other regions where the PRC has an interest in 
        promoting public sentiment in support of the Chinese Communist 
        Party and expanding the reach of its misleading narratives and 
        propaganda.
            (3) Even in Western democracies, the PRC spends extensively 
        on influence operations, such as a $500,000,000 advertising 
        campaign to attract cable viewers in Australia and a more than 
        $20,000,000 campaign to influence United States public opinion 
        via the China Daily newspaper supplement.
            (4) Radio Free Asia (referred to in this subsection as 
        ``RFA''), a private nonprofit multimedia news corporation, 
        which broadcasts in 9 East Asian languages including Mandarin, 
        Uyghur, Cantonese, and Tibetan, has succeeded in its mission to 
        reach audiences in China and in the Central Asia region despite 
        the Chinese Government's--
                    (A) efforts to practice ``media sovereignty,'' 
                which restricts access to the free press within China; 
                and
                    (B) campaign to spread disinformation to countries 
                abroad.
            (5) In 2019, RFA's Uyghur Service alerted the world to the 
        human rights abuses of Uyghur and other ethnic minorities in 
        China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
            (6) Gulchehra Hoja, a Uyghur journalist for RFA, received 
        the International Women's Media Foundation's Courage in 
        Journalism Award and a 2019 Magnitsky Human Rights Award for 
        her coverage of Xinjiang, while the Chinese Government detained 
        and harassed Ms. Hoja's China-based family and the families of 
        7 other RFA journalists in retaliation for their role in 
        exposing abuses.
            (7) In 2019 and 2020, RFA provided widely disseminated 
        print and digital coverage of the decline in freedom in Hong 
        Kong and the student-led protests of the extradition law.
            (8) In March 2020, RFA exposed efforts by the Chinese 
        Government to underreport the number of fatalities from the 
        novel coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan Province, China.
    (b) The United States Agency for Global Media.--The United States 
Agency for Global Media (USAGM) and affiliate Federal and non-Federal 
entities shall undertake the following actions to support independent 
journalism, counter disinformation, and combat surveillance in 
countries where the Chinese Communist Party and other malign actors are 
promoting disinformation, propaganda, and manipulated media markets:
            (1) Radio Free Asia (RFA) shall expand domestic coverage 
        and digital programming for all RFA China services and other 
        affiliate language broadcasting services.
            (2) USAGM shall increase funding for RFA's Mandarin, 
        Tibetan, Uyghur, and Cantonese language services.
            (3) Voice of America shall establish a real-time 
        disinformation tracking tool similar to Polygraph for Russian 
        language propaganda and misinformation.
            (4) USAGM shall expand existing training and partnership 
        programs that promote journalistic standards, investigative 
        reporting, cybersecurity, and digital analytics to help expose 
        and counter false CCP narratives.
            (5) The Open Technology Fund shall continue and expand its 
        work to support tools and technology to circumvent censorship 
        and surveillance by the CCP, both inside the PRC as well as 
        abroad where the PRC has exported censorship technology, and 
        increase secure peer-to-peer connectivity and privacy tools.
            (6) Voice of America shall continue and review 
        opportunities to expand its mission of providing timely, 
        accurate, and reliable news, programming, and content about the 
        United States, including news, culture, and values.
            (7) The networks and grantees of the United States Agency 
        for Global Media shall continue their mission of providing 
        credible and timely news coverage inclusive of the People's 
        Republic of China's activities in Xinjiang, including China's 
        ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity with respect to 
        Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims, including through strategic 
        amplification of Radio Free Asia's coverage, in its news 
        programming in majority-Muslim countries.
    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated, for each of fiscal years 2022 through 2026 for the United 
States Agency for Global Media, $100,000,000 for ongoing and new 
programs to support local media, build independent media, combat 
Chinese disinformation inside and outside of China, invest in 
technology to subvert censorship, and monitor and evaluate these 
programs, of which--
            (1) not less than $70,000,000 shall be directed to a grant

           TITLE II--INVESTING IN ALLIANCES AND PARTNERSHIPS

              Subtitle A--Strategic and Diplomatic Matters

SEC. 3201. APPROPRIATE COMMITTEES OF CONGRESS DEFINED.

    In this subtitle, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' 
means--
            (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the Senate; and
            (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on 
        Appropriations of the House of Representatives.

SEC. 3202. UNITED STATES COMMITMENT AND SUPPORT FOR ALLIES AND PARTNERS 
              IN THE INDO-PACIFIC.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States treaty alliances in the Indo-Pacific 
        provide a unique strategic advantage to the United States and 
        are among the Nation's most precious assets, enabling the 
        United States to advance its vital national interests, defend 
        its territory, expand its economy through international trade 
        and commerce, establish enduring cooperation among like-minded 
        countries, prevent the domination of the Indo-Pacific and its 
        surrounding maritime and air lanes by a hostile power or 
        powers, and deter potential aggressors;
            (2) the Governments of the United States, Japan, the 
        Republic of Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand are 
        critical allies in advancing a free and open order in the Indo-
        Pacific region and tackling challenges with unity of purpose, 
        and have collaborated to advance specific efforts of shared 
        interest in areas such as defense and security, economic 
        prosperity, infrastructure connectivity, and fundamental 
        freedoms;
            (3) the United States greatly values other partnerships in 
        the Indo-Pacific region, including with India, Singapore, 
        Indonesia, Taiwan, New Zealand, and Vietnam as well as regional 
        architecture such as the Quad, the Association of Southeast 
        Asian Nations (ASEAN), and the Asia-Pacific Economic Community 
        (APEC), which are essential to further shared interests;
            (4) the security environment in the Indo-Pacific demands 
        consistent United States and allied commitment to strengthening 
        and advancing our alliances so that they are postured to meet 
        these challenges, and will require sustained political will, 
        concrete partnerships, economic, commercial, and technological 
        cooperation, consistent and tangible commitments, high-level 
        and extensive consultations on matters of mutual interest, 
        mutual and shared cooperation in the acquisition of key 
        capabilities important to allied defenses, and unified mutual 
        support in the face of political, economic, or military 
        coercion;
            (5) fissures in the United States alliance relationships 
        and partnerships benefit United States adversaries and weaken 
        collective ability to advance shared interests;
            (6) the United States must work with allies to prioritize 
        human rights throughout the Indo-Pacific region;
            (7) as the report released in August 2020 by the Expert 
        Group of the International Military Council on Climate and 
        Security (IMCCS), titled ``Climate and Security in the Indo-
        Asia Pacific'' noted, the Indo-Pacific region is one of the 
        regions most vulnerable to climate impacts and as former Deputy 
        Under Secretary of Defense for Installations and Environment 
        Sherri Goodman, Secretary General of IMCCS, noted, climate 
        shocks act as a threat multiplier in the Indo-Pacific region, 
        increasing humanitarian response costs and impacting security 
        throughout the region as sea levels rise, fishing patterns 
        shift, food insecurity rises, and storms grow stronger and more 
        frequent;
            (8) the United State should continue to engage on and 
        deepen cooperation with allies and partners of the United 
        States in the Indo-Pacific region, as laid out in the Asia 
        Reassurance Initiative Act (Public Law 115-409), in the areas 
        of--
                    (A) forecasting environmental challenges;
                    (B) assisting with transnational cooperation on 
                sustainable uses of forest and water resources with the 
                goal of preserving biodiversity and access to safe 
                drinking water;
                    (C) fisheries and marine resource conservation; and
                    (D) meeting environmental challenges and developing 
                resilience; and
            (9) the Secretary of State, in coordination with the 
        Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of the United States 
        Agency for International Development, should facilitate a 
        robust interagency Indo-Pacific climate resiliency and 
        adaptation strategy focusing on internal and external actions 
        needed--
                    (A) to facilitate regional early recovery, risk 
                reduction, and resilience to weather-related impacts on 
                strategic interests of the United States and partners 
                and allies of the United States in the region; and
                    (B) to address humanitarian and food security 
                impacts of weather-related changes in the region.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States--
            (1) to deepen diplomatic, economic, and security 
        cooperation between and among the United States, Japan, the 
        Republic of Korea, Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand, 
        including through diplomatic engagement, regional development, 
        energy security and development, scientific and health 
        partnerships, educational and cultural exchanges, missile 
        defense, intelligence-sharing, space, cyber, and other 
        diplomatic and defense-related initiatives;
            (2) to uphold our multilateral and bilateral treaty 
        obligations, including--
                    (A) defending Japan, including all areas under the 
                administration of Japan, under article V of the Treaty 
                of Mutual Cooperation and Security Between the United 
                States of America and Japan;
                    (B) defending the Republic of Korea under article 
                III of the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United 
                States and the Republic of Korea;
                    (C) defending the Philippines under article IV of 
                the Mutual Defense Treaty Between the United States and 
                the Republic of the Philippines;
                    (D) defending Thailand under the 1954 Manila Pact 
                and the Thanat-Rusk communique of 1962; and
                    (E) defending Australia under article IV of the 
                Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty;
            (3) to strengthen and deepen the United States' bilateral 
        and regional partnerships, including with India, Taiwan, ASEAN, 
        and New Zealand;
            (4) to cooperate with Japan, the Republic of Korea, 
        Australia, the Philippines, and Thailand to promote human 
        rights bilaterally and through regional and multilateral fora 
        and pacts; and
            (5) to strengthen and advance diplomatic, economic, and 
        security cooperation with regional partners, such as Taiwan, 
        Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, and India.

SEC. 3203. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON COOPERATION WITH THE QUAD.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should reaffirm our commitment to 
        quadrilateral cooperation among Australia, India, Japan, and 
        the United States (the ``Quad'') to enhance and implement a 
        shared vision to meet shared regional challenges and to promote 
        a free, open, inclusive, resilient, and healthy Indo-Pacific 
        that is characterized by democracy, rule of law, and market-
        driven economic growth, and is free from undue influence and 
        coercion;
            (2) the United States should seek to expand sustained 
        dialogue and cooperation through the Quad with a range of 
        partners to support the rule of law, freedom of navigation and 
        overflight, peaceful resolution of disputes, democratic values, 
        and territorial integrity, and to uphold peace and prosperity 
        and strengthen democratic resilience;
            (3) the United States should seek to expand avenues of 
        cooperation with the Quad, including more regular military-to-
        military dialogues, joint exercises, and coordinated policies 
        related to shared interests such as protecting cyberspace and 
        advancing maritime security;
            (4) the recent pledge from the first-ever Quad leaders 
        meeting on March 12, 2021, to respond to the economic and 
        health impacts of COVID-19, including expanding safe, 
        affordable, and effective vaccine production and equitable 
        access, and to address shared challenges, including in 
        cyberspace, critical technologies, counterterrorism, quality 
        infrastructure investment, and humanitarian assistance and 
        disaster relief, as well as maritime domains, further advances 
        the important cooperation among Quad nations that is so 
        critical to the Indo-Pacific region;
            (5) building upon their partnership to help finance 
        1,000,000,000 or more COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 for 
        use in the Indo-Pacific region, the United States International 
        Development Finance Corporation, the Japan International 
        Cooperation Agency, and the Japan Bank for International 
        Cooperation, including through partnerships with other 
        multilateral development banks, should also venture to finance 
        development and infrastructure projects in the Indo-Pacific 
        region that are sustainable and offer a viable alternative to 
        the investments of the People's Republic of China in that 
        region under the Belt and Road Initiative;
            (6) in consultation with other Quad countries, the 
        President should establish clear deliverables for the 3 new 
        Quad Working Groups established on March 12, 2021, which are--
                    (A) the Quad Vaccine Experts Working Group;
                    (B) the Quad Climate Working Group; and
                    (C) the Quad Critical and Emerging Technology 
                Working Group; and
            (7) the formation of a Quad Intra-Parliamentary Working 
        Group could--
                    (A) sustain and deepen engagement between senior 
                officials of the Quad countries on a full spectrum of 
                issues; and
                    (B) be modeled on the successful and long-standing 
                bilateral intra-parliamentary groups between the United 
                States and Mexico, Canada, and the United Kingdom, as 
                well as other formal and informal parliamentary 
                exchanges.

SEC. 3205. STATEMENT OF POLICY ON COOPERATION WITH ASEAN.

    It is the policy of the United States to--

              COOPERATION ON TECHNOLOGY ISSUES WITH RESPECT TO THE

        about and collaborate on screening Chinese investments in 
        strategic technology sectors and critical infrastructure;

        appropriate import restriction regimes regarding Chinese 
        exports of surveillance technologies;
            (4) the United States should urge ASEAN to adopt its March 
        2019 proposed sanctions regime targeting cyber attacks;
            (5) the United States should urge ASEAN to commit to the 
        September 2019 principles signed by 28 countries regarding 
        ``Advancing Responsible State Behavior in Cyberspace'', a set 
        of commitments that support the ``rules-based international 
        order, affirm the applicability of international law to state-
        on-state behavior, adherence to voluntary norms of responsible 
        state behavior in peacetime, and the development and 
        implementation of practical confidence building measures to 
        help reduce the risk of conflict stemming from cyber 
        incidents''; and
            (6) the United States and ASEAN should explore how Chinese 
        investments in critical technology, including artificial 
        intelligence, will impact Indo-Pacific security over the coming 
        decades.

            (3) Despite a concerted campaign by the People's Republic 
        of China to isolate Taiwan from its diplomatic partners and 
        from international organizations, including the World Health 
        Organization, Taiwan has emerged as a global leader in the 
        coronavirus global pandemic response, including by donating 
        more than 2,000,000 surgical masks and other medical equipment 
        to the United States.
            (4) The creation of a United States fellowship program with 
        Taiwan would support--
                    (A) a key priority of expanding people-to-people 
                exchanges, which was outlined in President Donald J. 
                Trump's 2017 National Security Strategy;
                    (B) President Joseph R. Biden's commitment to 
                Taiwan, ``a leading democracy and a critical economic 
                and security partner,'' as expressed in his March 2021 
                Interim National Security Strategic Guidance; and
                    (C) April 2021 guidance from the Department of 
                State based on a review required under the Taiwan 
                Assurance Act of 2020 (subtitle B of title III of 
                division FF of Public Law 116-260) to ``encourage U.S. 
                government engagement with Taiwan that reflects our 
                deepening unofficial relationship''.
    (c) Purposes.--The purposes of this section are--
            (1) to further strengthen the United States-Taiwan

        of the United States Government to Taiwan for intensive study 
        in Mandarin and placement as Fellows with the governing 
        authorities on Taiwan or a Taiwanese civic institution;
            (2) to provide for eligible United States personnel to 
        learn or strengthen Mandarin Chinese language skills and to 
        expand their understanding of the political economy of Taiwan 
        and the Indo-Pacific region; and
            (3) to better position the United States to advance its 
        economic, security, and human rights interests and values in

                agree--
                            (i) to continue in the service of the 
                        sponsoring agency at the end of fellowship for 
                        a period of at least 4 years (or at least 2 
                        years if the fellowship duration is 1 year or 
                        shorter) unless the detailee is involuntarily

                        Federal Government in connection with the 
                        fellowship if the detailee voluntarily 
                        separates from service with the sponsoring 
                        agency before the end of the period for which

                enter into the service of another agency of the United 
                States Government unless the head of the sponsoring 
                agency notifies the detailee before the effective date

                Code; and
                    (C) may be assigned to a position with an entity 
                described in section (f)(4)(B)(i) if acceptance of such 
                position does not involve--
                            (i) the taking of an oath of allegiance to

                        allowance for up to 7 days if the fellow is

                        arriving in Taiwan;
                            (iv) an education allowance to assist 
                        parents in providing the fellow's minor 
                        children with educational services ordinarily

                        in their move to Taiwan, which is comparable to 
                        the allowance given for American Institute in 
                        Taiwan employees assigned to Taiwan; and
                            (vi) an economy-class airline ticket to and

SEC. 3217. REPORT ON ORIGINS OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is critical to understand the origins of the COVID-
        19 pandemic so the United States can better prepare, prevent, 
        and respond to pandemic health threats in the future;
            (2) given the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on all 
        Americans, the American people deserve to know what information 
        the United States Government possesses about the origins of 
        COVID-19, as appropriate;
            (3) Congress shares the concerns expressed by the United 
        States Government and 13 other foreign governments that the 
        international team of experts dispatched to the People's 
        Republic of China by the World Health Organization (WHO) to 
        study the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was ``significantly 
        delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and 
        samples'';
            (4) the March 30, 2021, statement by the Director-General 
        of the WHO, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, further affirms 
        that the investigative team had encountered ``difficulties'' in 
        accessing necessary raw data, that ``we have not yet found the 
        source of the virus,'' and that ``all hypotheses remain on the 
        table''; and
            (5) it is critical for independent experts to have full 
        access to all pertinent human, animal, and environmental data, 
        live virus samples, research, and personnel involved in the 
        early stages of the outbreak relevant to determining how this 
        pandemic emerged.
    (b) Report Required.--Not later than 180 days after enactment of 
this Act, the Director of National Intelligence, in coordination with 
the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the 
Secretary of Energy, and other relevant executive departments, shall 
submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report consisting 
of--
            (1) an assessment of the most likely source or origin of 
        the SARS-CoV-2 virus, including a detailed review of all 
        information the United States possesses that it has identified 
        as potentially relevant to the source or origin of the SARS-
        CoV-2 virus, including zoonotic transmission and spillover, the 
        Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV), or other sources of origin, 
        transmission, or spillover, based on the information the United 
        States Government has to date;
            (2) an identification of the leading credible theories of 
        the etiology of the SARS-CoV-2 virus by the United States 
        Government, the steps the United States has taken to validate 
        those theories, and any variance in assessment or dissent among 
        or between United States intelligence agencies, executive 
        agencies, and executive offices of the most likely source or 
        origin of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the basis for such variance 
        or dissent;
            (3) a description of all steps the United States Government 
        has taken to identify and investigate the source of the SARS-
        CoV-2 virus, including a timeline of such efforts;
            (4) a detailed description of the data to which the United 
        States and the WHO have requested and have access to in order 
        to determine the origin of the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus;
            (5) an account of efforts by the PRC to cooperate with, 
        impede, or obstruct any inquiry or investigation to determine 
        the source and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus, including into 
        a possible lab leak, or to create or spread misinformation or 
        disinformation regarding the source and transmission of SARS-
        CoV-2 virus by the PRC or CCP, including by national and local 
        governmental and health entities;
            (6) a detailed account of information known to the United 
        States Government regarding the WIV and associated facilities, 
        including research activities on coronaviruses and gain-of-
        function research, any reported illnesses of persons associated 
        with the laboratory with symptoms consistent with COVID-19 and 
        the ultimate diagnosis, and a timeline of research relevant to 
        coronaviruses;

SEC. 3219. INCREASING DEPARTMENT OF STATE PERSONNEL AND RESOURCES 
              DEVOTED TO THE INDO-PACIFIC.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In fiscal year 2020, the Department of State allocated 
        $1,500,000,000 to the Indo-Pacific region in bilateral and 
        regional foreign assistance (FA) resources, including as 
        authorized by section 201(b) of the Asia Reassurance Initiative 
        Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-409; 132 Stat. 5391), and 
        $798,000,000 in the fiscal year 2020 diplomatic engagement (DE) 
        budget. These amounts represent only 5 percent of the DE budget 
        and only 4 percent of the total Department of State-USAID 
        budget.
            (2) Over the last 5 years the DE budget and personnel 
        levels in the Indo-Pacific averaged only 5 percent of the 
        total, while FA resources averaged only 4 percent of the total.
            (3) In 2020, the Department of State began a process to 
        realign certain positions at posts to ensure that its personnel 
        footprint matches the demands of great-power competition, 
        including in the Indo-Pacific.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the size of the United States diplomatic corps must be 
        sufficient to meet the current and emerging challenges of the 
        21st century, including those posed by the PRC in the Indo-
        Pacific region and elsewhere;
            (2) the increase must be designed to meet the objectives of 
        an Indo-Pacific strategy focused on strengthening the good 
        governance and sovereignty of states that adhere to and uphold 
        the rules-based international order; and
            (3) the increase must be implemented with a focus on 
        increased numbers of economic, political, and public diplomacy 
        officers, representing a cumulative increase of at least 200 
        foreign service officer generalists, to--
                    (A) advance free, fair, and reciprocal trade and 
                open investment environments for United States 
                companies, and engaged in increased commercial 
                diplomacy in key markets;
                    (B) better articulate and explain United States 
                policies, strengthen civil society and democratic 
                principles, enhance reporting on Chinese the PRC's 
                global activities, promote people-to-people exchanges, 
                and advance United States influence; and
                    (C) increase capacity at small- and medium-sized 
                embassies and consulates in the Indo-Pacific and other 
                regions around the world, as necessary.
    (c) Statement of Policy.--
            (1) It shall be the policy of the United States to ensure 
        Department of State funding levels and personnel footprint in 
        the Indo-Pacific reflect the region's high degree of importance 
        and significance to United States political, economic, and 
        security interests.
            (2) It shall be the policy of the United States to increase

        total budget.
            (3) It shall be the policy of the United States to increase 
        the number of resident Defense attaches in the Indo-Pacific 
        region, particularly in locations where the People's Republic 
        of China has a resident military attache but the United States 
        does not, to assure coverage of all appropriate posts.

SEC. 3219B. ASIA REASSURANCE INITIATIVE ACT OF 2018.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Indo-Pacific region is home to many of the world's 
        most dynamic democracies, economic opportunities, as well as 
        many challenges to United States interests and values as a 
        result of the growth in authoritarian governance in the region 
        and by broad challenges posed by nuclear proliferation, the 
        changing environment, and deteriorating adherence to human 
        rights principles and obligations;
            (2) the People's Republic of China poses a particular 
        threat as it repeatedly violates internationally recognized 
        human rights, engages in unfair economic and trade practices, 
        disregards international laws and norms, coerces its neighbors, 
        engages in malign influence operations, and enables global 
        digital authoritarianism;
            (3) the Asia Reassurance Initiative Act of 2018 (referred 
        to in this section as ``ARIA'') enhances the United States' 
        commitment in the Indo-Pacific region by--
                    (A) expanding its defense cooperation with its 
                allies and partners;
                    (B) investing in democracy and the protection of 
                human rights;

                    (D) supporting people-to-people engagement and 
                other shared priorities; and
            (4) the 2019 Department of Defense Indo-Pacific Strategy 
        Report concludes that ARIA ``enshrines a generational whole-of-
        government policy framework that demonstrates U.S. commitment 
        to a free and open Indo-Pacific region''.
    (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--The Asia Reassurance 
Initiative Act of 2018 (Public Law 115-409) is amended--
            (1) in section 201(b), by striking ``$1,500,000,000 for

              ACTION ON HUMAN RIGHTS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--Congress--
            (1) notes with growing concern that the People's Republic 
        of China and Russia have, at the United Nations, aligned with 
        one another in blocking Security Council action on Syria, 
        Myanmar, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and other countries credibly 
        accused of committing human rights abuses;
            (2) recognizes that it is not only the use of the veto on 
        the United Nations Security Council, but also the threat of the 
        use of a veto, that can prevent the Security Council from 
        taking actions aimed at protecting human rights;
            (3) condemns efforts by China and Russia to undermine 
        United Nations Security Council actions aimed at censuring

            (4) denounces the tactical alignment between the People's 
        Republic of China and Russia within the United Nations Security 
        Council to challenge the protection of human rights and the 
        guarantee of humanitarian access.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It shall be the policy of the United 
States to--
            (1) reaffirm its commitment to maintain international peace 
        and security, develop friendly relations among nations, and 
        cooperate in solving international problems and promoting 
        respect for human rights;
            (2) highlight efforts by the People's Republic of China and 
        Russia to undermine international peace and security, protect 
        human rights, and guarantee humanitarian access to those in 
        need;
            (3) increase the role and presence of the United States at 
        the United Nations and its constituent bodies to advance United 
        States interests, including by counteracting malign Chinese and 
        Russian influence; and
            (4) urge allies and like-minded partners to work together 
        with the United States to overcome Chinese and Russian efforts 
        to weaken the United Nations Security Council by preventing it

SEC. 3222. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The People's Republic of China aims to use its growing 
        military might in concert with other instruments of its 
        national power to displace the United States in the Indo-
        Pacific and establish hegemony over the region.
            (2) The military balance of power in the Indo-Pacific 
        region is growing increasingly unfavorable to the United States 
        because--
                    (A) the PRC is rapidly modernizing and expanding 
                the capabilities of the PLA to project power and create 
                contested areas across the entire Indo-Pacific region;
                    (B) PLA modernization has largely focused on areas 
                where it possesses operational advantages and can 
                exploit weaknesses in the United States suite of 
                capabilities; and
                    (C) current United States force structure and 
                presence do not sufficiently counter threats in the 
                Indo-Pacific, as United States allies, bases, and 
                forces at sea in the Indo-Pacific region are 
                concentrated in large bases that are highly vulnerable 
                to the PRC's strike capabilities.
            (3) This shift in the regional military balance and erosion 
        of conventional and strategic deterrence in the Indo-Pacific 
        region--
                    (A) presents a substantial and imminent risk to the 
                security of the United States; and
                    (B) left unchecked, could--
                            (i) embolden the PRC to take actions, 
                        including the use of military force, to change 
                        the status quo before the United States can 
                        mount an effective response; and
                            (ii) alter the nuclear balance in the Indo-
                        Pacific.
            (4) The PRC sees an opportunity to diminish confidence 
        among United States allies and partners in the strength of 
        United States commitments, even to the extent that these 
        nations feel compelled to bandwagon with the PRC to protect 
        their interests. The PRC is closely monitoring the United 
        States reaction to PRC pressure and coercion of United States 
        allies, searching for indicators of United States resolve.
            (5) Achieving so-called ``reunification'' of Taiwan to 
        mainland China is a key step for the PRC to achieve its 
        regional hegemonic ambitions. The PRC has increased the 
        frequency and scope of its exercises and operations targeting 
        Taiwan, such as amphibious assault and live-fire exercises in 
        the Taiwan Strait, PLA Air Force flights that encircle Taiwan, 
        and flights across the unofficial median line in the Taiwan 
        Strait. The Government of the PRC's full submission of Hong 
        Kong potentially accelerates the timeline of a Taiwan scenario, 
        and makes the defense of Taiwan an even more urgent priority.
            (6) The defense of Taiwan is critical to--
                    (A) defending the people of Taiwan;
                    (B) limiting the PLA's ability to project power 
                beyond the First Island Chain, including to United 
                States territory, such as Guam and Hawaii;
                    (C) defending the territorial integrity of Japan;
                    (D) preventing the PLA from diverting military 
                planning, resources, and personnel to broader military 
                ambitions; and
                    (E) retaining the United States credibility as a 
                defender of the democratic values and free-market 
                principles embodied by Taiwan's people and government;
            (7) The PRC capitalized on the world's attention to COVID-
        19 to advance its military objectives in the South China Sea, 
        intensifying and accelerating trends already underway. The PRC 
        has sent militarized survey vessels into the Malaysian 
        Exclusive Economic Zone, announced the establishment of an 
        administrative district in the Spratly and Paracel Islands 
        under the Chinese local government of Sansha, aimed a fire 
        control radar at a Philippine navy ship, encroached on 
        Indonesia's fishing grounds, sunk a Vietnamese fishing boat, 
        announced new ``research stations'' on Fiery Cross Reef and 
        Subi Reef, landed special military aircraft on Fiery Cross Reef 
        to routinize such deployments, and sent a flotilla of over 200 
        militia vessels to Whitsun Reef, a feature within the exclusive 
        economic zone of the Philippines.
            (8) On July 13, 2020, the Department of State clarified 
        United States policy on the South China Sea and stated that 
        ``Beijing's claims to offshore resources across most of the 
        South China Sea are completely unlawful''.
            (9) These actions in the South China Sea enable the PLA to 
        exert influence and project power deeper into Oceania and the 
        Indian Ocean. As Admiral Phil Davidson, Commander of Indo-
        Pacific Command, testified in 2019, ``In short, China is now 
        capable of controlling the South China Sea in all scenarios 
        short of war with the United States.''.
            (10) The PLA also continues to advance its claims in the 
        East China Sea, including through a high number of surface 
        combatant patrols and frequent entry into the territorial 
        waters of the Senkaku Islands, over which the United States 
        recognizes Japan's administrative control. In April 2014, 
        President Barack Obama stated, ``Our commitment to Japan's 
        security is absolute and article five of the U.S.-Japan 
        security treaty covers all territory under Japan's 
        administration, including the Senkaku islands.''.
            (11) On March 1, 2019, Secretary of State Michael R. Pompeo 
        stated, ``As the South China Sea is part of the Pacific, any 
        armed attack on Philippine forces, aircraft, or public vessels 
        in the South China Sea will trigger mutual defense obligations 
        under Article 4 of our Mutual Defense Treaty.''.
            (12) The PLA also continues to advance its influence over 
        the Korean Peninsula, including through a series of joint air 
        exercises with the Russian Federation in the Republic of 
        Korea's Air Defense Identification Zone.
            (13) The PLA is modernizing and gaining critical capability 
        in every branch and every domain, including--
                    (A) positioning the PLA Navy to become a great 
                maritime power or ``blue-water'' navy that can 
                completely control all activity within the First Island 
                Chain and project power beyond it with a fleet of 425 
                battle force ships by 2030;
                    (B) increasing the size and range of its strike 
                capabilities, including approximately 1,900 ground-
                launched short- and intermediate-range missiles capable 
                of targeting United States allies and partners in the 
                First and Second Island chains, United States bases in 
                the Indo-Pacific, and United States forces at sea;
                    (C) boosting capabilities for air warfare, 
                including with Russian-origin Su-35 fighters and S-400 
                air defense systems, new J-20 5th generation stealth 
                fighters, advanced H-6 bomber variants, a long-range 
                stealth bomber, and Y-20 heavy lift aircraft;
                    (D) making critical investments in new domains of 
                warfare, such as cyber warfare, electronic warfare, and 
                space warfare; and
                    (E) increasing the size of its nuclear stockpile 
                and delivery systems.
            (14) The PRC is pursuing this modernization through all 
        means at its disposal, including its Military-Civil Fusion 
        initiative, which enlists the whole of PRC society in 
        developing and acquiring technology with military applications 
        to pursue technological advantage over the United States in 
        artificial intelligence, hypersonic glide vehicles, directed 
        energy weapons, electromagnetic railguns, counter-space 
        weapons, and other emerging capabilities.
            (15) The United States lead in the development of science 
        and technology relevant to defense is eroding in the face of 
        competition from the PRC. United States research and 
        development spending on defense capabilities has declined 
        sharply as a share of global research and development. The 
        commercial sector's leading role in innovation presents certain 
        unique challenges to the Department of Defense's reliance on 
        technology for battlefield advantage.
            (16) The PRC has vastly increased domestic research and 
        development expenditures, supported the growth of new cutting-
        edge industries and tapped into a large workforce to invest in 
        fostering science and engineering talent.
            (17) The PRC is increasing exports of defense and security 
        capabilities to build its defense technology and industrial 
        base and improve its own military capabilities, as well as its 
        influence with countries that purchase and become dependent on 
        its military systems.

SEC. 3223. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING BOLSTERING SECURITY PARTNERSHIPS 
              IN THE INDO-PACIFIC.

    It is the sense of Congress that steps to bolster United States 
security partnerships in the Indo-Pacific must include--
            (1) supporting Japan in its development of long-range 
        precision fires, munitions, air and missile defense capacity, 
        interoperability across all domains, maritime security, and 
        intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities;
            (2) launching a United States-Japan national security 
        innovation fund to solicit and support private sector 
        cooperation for new technologies that could benefit the United 
        States and Japan's mutual security objectives;
            (3) promoting a deeper defense relationship between Japan 
        and Australia, including supporting reciprocal access 
        agreements and trilateral United States-Japan-Australia 
        intelligence sharing;
            (4) encouraging and facilitating Taiwan's accelerated 
        acquisition of asymmetric defense capabilities, which are 
        crucial to defending the islands of Taiwan from invasion, 
        including long-range precision fires, munitions, anti-ship 
        missiles, coastal defense, anti-armor, air defense, undersea 
        warfare, advanced command, control, communications, computers, 
        intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (C4ISR), and 
        resilient command and control capabilities, and increasing the 
        conduct of relevant and practical training and exercises with 
        Taiwan's defense forces; and
            (5) prioritizing building the capacity of United States 
        allies and partners to protect defense technology.

SEC. 3224. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It shall be the policy of the United States to--
            (1) prioritize the Indo-Pacific region in United States 
        foreign policy, and prioritize resources for achieving United 
        States political and military objectives in the region;
            (2) exercise freedom of operations in the international 
        waters and airspace in the Indo-Pacific maritime domains, which 
        are critical to the prosperity, stability, and security of the 
        Indo-Pacific region;
            (3) maintain forward-deployed forces in the Indo-Pacific 
        region, including a rotational bomber presence, integrated 
        missile defense capabilities, long-range precision fires, 
        undersea warfare capabilities, and diversified and resilient 
        basing and rotational presence, including support for pre-
        positioning strategies;
            (4) strengthen and deepen the alliances and partnerships of 
        the United States to build capacity and capabilities, increase 
        multilateral partnerships, modernize communications 
        architecture, address anti-access and area denial challenges, 
        and increase joint exercises and security cooperation efforts;
            (5) reaffirm the commitment and support of the United 
        States for allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region, 
        including longstanding United States policy regarding--
                    (A) Article V of the Treaty of Mutual Cooperation

                    (C) Article IV of the Mutual Defense Treaty between 
                the United States and the Republic of the Philippines, 
                signed at Washington August 30, 1951, including that, 
                as the South China Sea is part of the Pacific, any 
                armed attack on Philippine forces, aircraft or public 
                vessels in the South China Sea will trigger mutual 
                defense obligations under Article IV of our mutual 
                defense treaty;
                    (D) Article IV of the Australia, New Zealand, 
                United States Security Treaty, done at San Francisco 
                September 1, 1951; and
                    (E) the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, 
                done at Manila September 8, 1954, together with the 
                Thanat-Rusk Communique of 1962;
            (6) collaborate with United States treaty allies in the 
        Indo-Pacific to foster greater multilateral security and 
        defense cooperation with other regional partners;
            (7) ensure the continuity of operations by the United 
        States Armed Forces in the Indo-Pacific region, including, as 
        appropriate, in cooperation with partners and allies, in order 
        to reaffirm the principle of freedom of operations in 
        international waters and airspace in accordance with 
        established principles and practices of international law;
            (8) sustain the Taiwan Relations Act (Public Law 96-8; 22 
        U.S.C. 3301 et seq.) and the ``Six Assurances'' provided by the 
        United States to Taiwan in July 1982 as the foundations for 
        United States-Taiwan relations, and to deepen, to the fullest 
        extent possible, the extensive, close, and friendly relations 
        of the United States and Taiwan, including cooperation to 
        support the development of capable, ready, and modern forces 
        necessary for the defense of Taiwan;
            (9) enhance security partnerships with India, across 
        Southeast Asia, and with other nations of the Indo-Pacific;
            (10) deter acts of aggression or coercion by the PRC 
        against United States and allies' interests, especially along 
        the First Island Chain and in the Western Pacific, by showing 
        PRC leaders that the United States can and is willing to deny 
        them the ability to achieve their objectives, including by--
                    (A) consistently demonstrating the political will 
                of the United States to deepening existing treaty 
                alliances and growing new partnerships as a durable, 
                asymmetric, and unmatched strategic advantage to the 
                PRC's growing military capabilities and reach;
                    (B) maintaining a system of forward-deployed bases 
                in the Indo-Pacific region as the most visible sign of 
                United States resolve and commitment to the region, and 
                as platforms to ensure United States operational 
                readiness and advance interoperability with allies and 
                partners;
                    (C) adopting a more dispersed force posture 
                throughout the region, particularly the Western 
                Pacific, and pursuing maximum access for United States 
                mobile and relocatable launchers for long-range cruise, 
                ballistic, and hypersonic weapons throughout the Indo-
                Pacific region;
                    (D) fielding long-range, precision-strike networks 
                to United States and allied forces, including ground-
                launched cruise missiles, undersea and naval 
                capabilities, and integrated air and missile defense in 
                the First Island Chain and the Second Island Chain, in 
                order to deter and prevent PRC coercion and aggression, 
                and to maximize the United States ability to operate;
                    (E) strengthening extended deterrence to ensure 
                that escalation against key United States interests 
                would be costly, risky, and self-defeating; and
                    (F) collaborating with allies and partners to 
                accelerate their roles in more equitably sharing the 
                burdens of mutual defense, including through the 
                acquisition and fielding of advanced capabilities and 
                training that will better enable them to repel PRC 
                aggression or coercion; and
            (11) maintain the capacity of the United States to impose 
        prohibitive diplomatic, economic, financial, reputational, and 
        military costs on the PRC for acts of coercion or aggression,

        lawful use of the sea, or the airspace above it, that belong to 
        all nations, and oppose the militarization of new and reclaimed 
        land features in the South China Sea;

                Philippines' Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) or on its 
                continental shelf;

            (5) ensure that disputes are managed without intimidation, 
        coercion, or force;
            (6) call on all claimants to clarify or adjust claims in

            (7) uphold the principle that territorial and maritime

        be derived from land features and otherwise comport with 
        international law;

        covering disputed areas in the South China Sea, regulations

            (9) support an effective Code of Conduct, if that Code of 
        Conduct reflects the interests of Southeast Asian claimant 
        states and does not serve as a vehicle for the People's 
        Republic of China to advance its unlawful maritime claims;
            (10) reaffirm that an existing body of international rules 
        and guidelines, including the International Regulations for 
        Preventing Collisions at Sea, done at London October 12, 1972

        region and reinforce the role of international law;
            (12) encourage the deepening of partnerships with other 
        countries in the region for maritime domain awareness and 
        capacity building, as well as efforts by the United States 
        Government to explore the development of appropriate 
        multilateral mechanisms for a ``common operating picture'' in 
        the South China Sea among Southeast Asian countries that would 
        serve to help countries avoid destabilizing behavior and deter 
        risky and dangerous activities;
            (13) oppose actions by any country to prevent any other 
        country from exercising its sovereign rights to the resources 
        of the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) and continental shelf by 
        making claims to those areas in the South China Sea that have 
        no support in international law; and
            (14) assure the continuity of operations by the United 
        States in the Indo-Pacific region, including, when appropriate, 
        in cooperation with partners and allies, to reaffirm the

        airspace in accordance with established principles and 
        practices of international law.

        alliance roles, missions and capabilities, prioritizing allies 
        and partners in the Indo-Pacific region in accordance with 
        United States strategic imperatives;
            (2) the United States should design for export to Indo-
        Pacific allies and partners capabilities critical to

        surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, and command and 
        control systems;
            (3) the United States should pursue, to the maximum extent 
        possible, anticipatory technology security and foreign 
        disclosure policy on the systems described in paragraph (2); 
        and
            (4) the Secretary of State, in coordination with the 
        Secretary of Defense, should--
                    (A) urge allies and partners to invest in 
                sufficient quantities of munitions to meet contingency 
                requirements and avoid the need for accessing United 
                States stocks in wartime; and
                    (B) cooperate with allies to deliver such

                    (E) assess the resources necessary to meet the

            (1) a more streamlined, shared, and coordinated approach,

        necessary for the United States to retain its lead in defense 
        technology;

        defense-related technologies and services to members of the 
        national technology and industrial base (as defined in section 
        2500 of title 10, United States Code) would advance United 
        States security interests by helping to leverage the defense-
        related technologies and skilled workforces of trusted allies 
        to reduce the dependence on other countries, including 
        countries that pose challenges to United States interests 
        around the world, for defense-related innovation and 
        investment; and
            (3) it is in the interest of the United States to continue 
        to increase cooperation with Australia, Canada, and the United 
        Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to protect 
        critical defense-related technology and services and leverage 
        the investments of like-minded, major ally nations in order to

        innovation.

SEC. 3234. STATEMENT OF POLICY REGARDING UNIVERSAL IMPLEMENTATION OF 
              UNITED NATIONS SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA.

    It is the policy of the United States to sustain maximum economic 
pressure on the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea 
(referred to in this section as the ``DPRK'') until the regime 
undertakes complete, verifiable, and irreversible actions toward 
denuclearization, including by--
            (1) pressing all nations, including the PRC, to implement 
        and enforce existing United Nations sanctions with regard to 
        the DPRK;
            (2) pressing all nations, including the PRC, and in 
        accordance with United Nations Security Council resolutions, to 
        end the practice of hosting DPRK citizens as guest workers, 
        recognizing that such workers are demonstrated to constitute an 
        illicit source of revenue for the DPRK regime and its nuclear 
        ambitions;
            (3) pressing all nations, including the PRC, to pursue 
        rigorous interdiction of shipments to and from the DPRK, 
        including ship-to-ship transfers, consistent with United 
        Nations Security Council resolutions;
            (4) pressing the PRC and PRC entities--
                    (A) to cease business activities with United 
                Nations-designated entities and their affiliates in the 
                DPRK; and
                    (B) to expel from the PRC individuals who enable 
                the DPRK to acquire materials for its nuclear and 
                ballistic missile programs; and
            (5) enforcing United Nations Security Council resolutions 
        with respect to the DPRK and United States sanctions, including 
        those pursuant to the North Korea Sanctions and Policy 
        Enhancement Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-122), the Countering 
        America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (Public Law 115-
        44), the Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions and

SEC. 3235. LIMITATION ON ASSISTANCE TO COUNTRIES HOSTING CHINESE 
              MILITARY INSTALLATIONS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) although it casts the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) as 
        a development initiative, the People's Republic of China is 
        also utilizing the BRI to advance its own security interests, 
        including to expand its power projection capabilities and 
        facilitate greater access for the People's Liberation Army 
        through overseas military installations; and
            (2) the expansion of the People's Liberation Army globally 
        through overseas military installations will undermine the 
        medium- and long-term security of the United States and the 
        security and development of strategic partners in critical 
        regions around the world, which is at odds with United States 
        goals to promote peace, prosperity, and self-reliance among 
        partner nations, including through the Millennium Challenge 
        Corporation.
    (b) Limitation on Assistance.--Except as provided in subsection 
(c), for fiscal years 2022 through 2031, the government of a country 
that is hosting on its territory a military installation of the 
Government of the People's Republic of China or facilitates the 
expansion of the presence of the People's Liberation Army for purposes 
other than participating in United Nations peacekeeping operations or 
for temporary humanitarian, medical, and disaster relief operations in 
such country shall not be eligible for assistance under sections 609 or 
616 of the Millennium Challenge Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7708, 7715).
    (c) National Interest Waiver.--The President may, on a case by case 
basis, waive the limitation in subsection (b) if the President submits 
to the appropriate congressional committees--
            (1) a written determination that the waiver is important to 
        the national interests of the United States; and
            (2) a detailed explanation of how the waiver is important 
        to those interests.

              AROUND THE WORLD WITH RESPECT TO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF 
              CHINA.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to strengthen alliances and partnerships in Europe and 
        with like-minded countries around the globe to effectively 
        compete with the People's Republic of China; and
            (2) to work in collaboration with such allies and 
        partners--
                    (A) to address significant diplomatic, economic, 
                and military challenges posed by the People's Republic 
                of China;
                    (B) to deter the People's Republic of China from 
                pursuing military aggression;
                    (C) to promote the peaceful resolution of 
                territorial disputes in accordance with international 
                law;
                    (D) to promote private sector-led long-term 
                economic development while countering efforts by the 
                Government of the People's Republic of China to 
                leverage predatory economic practices as a means of 
                political and economic coercion in the Indo-Pacific 
                region and beyond;
                    (E) to promote the values of democracy and human 
                rights, including through efforts to end the repression 
                by the Chinese Communist Party of political dissidents, 
                Uyghurs, and other ethnic Muslim minorities, Tibetan 
                Buddhists, Christians, and other minorities;
                    (F) to respond to the crackdown by the Chinese 
                Communist Party, in contravention of the commitments 
                made under the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984 
                and the Basic Law of Hong Kong, on the legitimate 
                aspirations of the people of Hong Kong; and
                    (G) to counter the Chinese Communist Party's 
                efforts to spread disinformation in the People's 
                Republic of China and beyond with respect to the 
                response of the Chinese Communist Party to COVID-19.

                       PART I--WESTERN HEMISPHERE

SEC. 3245. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING UNITED STATES-CANADA RELATIONS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States and Canada have a unique relationship 
        based on shared geography, extensive personal connections, deep 
        economic ties, mutual defense commitments, and a shared vision 
        to uphold democracy, human rights, and the rules based 
        international order established after World War II;
            (2) the United States and Canada can better address the 
        People's Republic of China's economic, political, and security 
        influence through closer cooperation on counternarcotics, 
        environmental stewardship, transparent practices in public 
        procurement and infrastructure planning, the Arctic, energy and 
        connectivity issues, trade and commercial relations, bilateral 
        legal matters, and support for democracy, good governance, and 
        human rights;
            (3) amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, the United States and 
        Canada should maintain joint initiatives to address border 
        management, commercial and trade relations and infrastructure, 
        a shared approach with respect to the People's Republic of 
        China, and transnational challenges, including pandemics, 
        energy security, and environmental stewardship;
            (4) the United States and Canada should enhance cooperation 
        to counter Chinese disinformation, influence operations, 
        economic espionage, and propaganda efforts;
            (5) the People's Republic of China's infrastructure 
        investments, particularly in 5G telecommunications technology, 
        extraction of natural resources, and port infrastructure, pose 
        national security risks for the United States and Canada;
            (6) the United States should share, as appropriate, 
        intelligence gathered regarding--
                    (A) Huawei's 5G capabilities; and
                    (B) the PRC government's intentions with respect to 
                5G expansion;
            (7) the United States and Canada should continue to advance 
        collaborative initiatives to implement the January 9, 2020, 
        United States-Canada Joint Action Plan on Critical Minerals 
        Development Collaboration; and
            (8) the United States and Canada must prioritize 
        cooperation on continental defense and in the Arctic, including 
        by modernizing the North American Aerospace Defense Command 
        (NORAD) to effectively defend the Northern Hemisphere against 
        the range of threats by peer competitors, including long-range 
        missiles and high-precision weapons.

SEC. 3246. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S 
              REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S ARBITRARY IMPRISONMENT OF CANADIAN 
              CITIZENS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Government of the People's Republic of China's 
        apparent arbitrary detention and abusive treatment of Canadian 
        nationals Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig in apparent 
        retaliation for the Government of Canada's arrest of Meng 
        Wanzhou is deeply concerning;
            (2) the Government of Canada has shown international 
        leadership by--
                    (A) upholding the rule of law and complying with 
                its international legal obligations, including those 
                pursuant to the Extradition Treaty Between the United 
                States of America and Canada, signed at Washington 
                December 3, 1971; and
                    (B) launching the Declaration Against Arbitrary 
                Detention in State-to-State Relations, which has been 
                endorsed by 57 countries and the European Union, and 
                reaffirms well-established prohibitions under 
                international human rights conventions against the 
                arbitrary detention of foreign nationals to be used as 
                leverage in state-to-state relations; and

            (1) since 2005, the Government of the People's Republic of

            (2) several countries in Latin American and the Caribbean 
        that have received a significant amount of sovereign lending 
        from the Government of the People's Republic of China face 
        challenges in repaying such loans;
            (3) the Government of the People's Republic of China's 
        predatory economic practices and sovereign lending practices in 
        Latin America and the Caribbean negatively influence United 
        States national interests in the Western Hemisphere;
            (4) the Inter-American Development Bank, the premier 
        multilateral development bank dedicated to the Western 
        Hemisphere, should play a significant role supporting the 
        countries of Latin America and the Caribbean in achieving 
        sustainable and serviceable debt structures; and
            (5) a tenth general capital increase for the Inter-American

        the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean achieve 
        sustainable and serviceable debt structures.

take steps to support a tenth general capital increase for the Inter-

        restructure debt resulting from sovereign lending by the

        achieve sustainable and serviceable debt structures; and
            (2) to establish appropriate safeguards and transparency 
        and conditionality measures to protect debt-vulnerable member 
        countries of the Inter-American Development Bank that borrow 
        from the Bank for the purposes of restructuring Chinese

        companies with close ties to or that are susceptible to 
        pressure from governments or security services without reliable 
        legal checks on governmental powers can lead to breaches of

        of human rights, and harassment of political opponents.

diplomatic engagement with governments and civil society organizations 
in Latin America and the Caribbean to--

                    PART II--TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE

SEC. 3255. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE TRANSATLANTIC ALLIANCE.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States, European Union, and European 
        countries are close partners, sharing values grounded in 
        democracy, human rights, transparency, and the rules-based 
        international order established after World War II;
            (2) without a common approach by the United States, 
        European Union, and European countries on connectivity, trade, 
        transnational problems, and support for democracy and human 
        rights, the People's Republic of China will continue to 
        increase its economic, political, and security leverage in 
        Europe;
            (3) the People's Republic of China's deployment of 
        assistance to European countries following the COVID-19 
        outbreak showcased a coercive approach to aid, but it also 
        highlighted Europe's deep economic ties to the People's 
        Republic of China;
            (4) as European states seek to recover from the economic 
        toll of the COVID-19 outbreak, the United States must stand in 
        partnership with Europe to support our collective economic 
        recovery, reinforce our collective national security, and 
        defend shared values;
            (5) the United States, European Union, and European 
        countries should coordinate on joint strategies to diversify 
        reliance on supply chains away from the People's Republic of 
        China, especially in the medical and pharmaceutical sectors;
            (6) the United States, European Union, and European 
        countries should leverage their respective economic innovation 
        capabilities to support the global economic recovery from the 
        COVID-19 recession and draw a contrast with the centralized 
        economy of the People's Republic of China;
            (7) the United States, United Kingdom, and European Union 
        should accelerate efforts to de-escalate their trade disputes, 
        including negotiating a United States-European Union trade 
        agreement that benefits workers and the broader economy in both 
        the United States and European Union;
            (8) the United States, European Union, and Japan should 
        continue trilateral efforts to address economic challenges 
        posed by the People's Republic of China;
            (9) the United States, European Union, and countries of 
        Europe should enhance cooperation to counter PRC 
        disinformation, influence operations, and propaganda efforts;
            (10) the United States and European nations share serious 
        concerns with the repressions being supported and executed by 
        the Government of the People's Republic of China, and should 
        continue implementing measures to address the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China's specific abuses in Tibet, Hong 
        Kong, and Xinjiang, and should build joint mechanisms and 
        programs to prevent the export of China's authoritarian 
        governance model to countries around the world;
            (11) the United States and European nations should remain 
        united in their shared values against attempts by the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China at the United 
        Nations and other multilateral organizations to promote efforts 
        that erode the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, like the 
        ``community of a shared future for mankind'' and 
        ``democratization of international relations'';
            (12) the People's Republic of China's infrastructure 
        investments around the world, particularly in 5G 
        telecommunications technology and port infrastructure, could 
        threaten democracy across Europe and the national security of 
        key countries;
            (13) as appropriate, the United States should share 
        intelligence with European allies and partners on Huawei's 5G

        People's Republic of China with respect to 5G expansion in 
        Europe;
            (14) the European Union's Investment Screening Regulation, 
        which came into force in October 2020, is a welcome 
        development, and member states should closely scrutinize PRC 
        investments in their countries through their own national 
        investment screening measures;
            (15) the President should actively engage the European 
        Union on the implementation of the Export Control Reform Act 
        regulations and to better harmonize United States and European 
        Union policies with respect to export controls;
            (16) the President should strongly advocate for the listing 
        of more items and technologies to restrict dual use exports 
        controlled at the National Security and above level to the 
        People's Republic of China under the Wassenaar Arrangement;
            (17) the United States should explore the value of 
        establishing a body akin to the Coordinating Committee for 
        Multilateral Export Controls (CoCom) that would specifically 
        coordinate United States and European Union export control 
        policies with respect to limiting exports of sensitive 
        technologies to the People's Republic of China; and
            (18) the United States should work with counterparts in 
        Europe to--
                    (A) evaluate United States and European 
                overreliance on goods originating in the People's 
                Republic of China, including in the medical and 
                pharmaceutical sectors, and develop joint strategies to 
                diversify supply chains;
                    (B) counter PRC efforts to use COVID-19-related 
                assistance as a coercive tool to pressure developing 
                countries by offering relevant United States and 
                European expertise and assistance; and
                    (C) leverage the United States and European private 
                sectors to advance the post-COVID-19 economic recovery.

SEC. 3281. STRATEGY TO COUNTER CHINESE INFLUENCE IN, AND ACCESS TO, THE 
              MIDDLE EAST AND NORTH AFRICA.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the economic influence of the People's Republic of 
        China through its oil and gas imports from the Middle East, 
        infrastructure investments, technology transfer, and arms sales 
        provides influence and leverage that runs counter to United 
        States interests in the region;
            (2) the People's Republic of China seeks to erode United 
        States influence in the Middle East and North Africa through 
        the sale of Chinese arms, associated weapons technology, and 
        joint weapons research and development initiatives;
            (3) the People's Republic of China seeks to establish 
        military or dual use facilities in geographically strategic 
        locations in the Middle East and North Africa to further the 
        Chinese Communist Party's Belt and Road Initiative at the 
        expense of United States national security interests; and
            (4) the export of certain communications infrastructure 
        from the People's Republic of China degrades the security of 
        partner networks, exposes intellectual property to theft, 
        threatens the ability of the United States to conduct security 
        cooperation with compromised regional partners, and furthers 
        China's authoritarian surveillance model.
    (b) Strategy Required.--

        appropriate Federal agencies, shall jointly develop and submit 
        to the appropriate congressional committees a strategy for

        the Middle East and North Africa.
            (2) Elements.--The strategy required under paragraph (1)

            (1) The United States and the international community have 
        long-term interests in the stability, security, and prosperity 
        of the people of the Middle East and North Africa.
            (2) In addition to and apart from military and security 
        efforts, the United States should harness a whole of government 
        approach, including bilateral and multilateral statecraft, 
        economic lines of effort, and public diplomacy to compete with 
        and counter Chinese Communist Party influence.
            (3) A clearly articulated positive narrative of United 
        States engagement, transparent governance structures, and 
        active civil society engagement help counter predatory foreign 
        investment and influence efforts.

SEC. 3285. ARCTIC DIPLOMACY.

    (a) Sense of Congress on Arctic Security.--It is the sense of 
Congress that--
            (1) the rapidly changing Arctic environment--
                    (A) creates new national and regional security 
                challenges due to increased military activity in the 
                Arctic;
                    (B) heightens the risk of the Arctic emerging as a 
                major theater of conflict in ongoing strategic 
                competition;
                    (C) threatens maritime safety as Arctic littoral 
                nations have inadequate capacity to patrol the 
                increased vessel traffic in this remote region, which 
                is a result of diminished annual levels of sea ice;
                    (D) impacts public safety due to increased human 
                activity in the Arctic region where search and rescue 
                capacity remains very limited; and
                    (E) threatens the health of the Arctic's fragile 
                and pristine environment and the unique and highly 
                sensitive species found in the Arctic's marine and 
                terrestrial ecosystems; and
            (2) the United States should reduce the consequences 
        outlined in paragraph (1) by--
                    (A) carefully evaluating the wide variety and 
                dynamic set of security and safety risks unfolding in 
                the Arctic;
                    (B) developing policies and making preparations to 
                mitigate and respond to threats and risks in the 
                Arctic, including by continuing to work with allies and 
                partners in the Arctic region to deter potential 
                aggressive activities and build Arctic competencies;
                    (C) adequately funding the National Earth System 
                Prediction Capability to substantively improve weather, 
                ocean, and ice predictions on the time scales necessary 
                to ensure regional security and trans-Arctic shipping;
                    (D) investing in resources, including a 
                significantly expanded icebreaker fleet, to ensure that 
                the United States has adequate capacity to prevent and 
                respond to security threats in the Arctic region;
                    (E) pursuing diplomatic engagements with all 
                nations in the Arctic region for--
                            (i) maintaining peace and stability in the 
                        Arctic region;
                            (ii) fostering cooperation on stewardship 
                        and safety initiatives in the Arctic region;
                            (iii) ensuring safe and efficient 
                        management of commercial maritime traffic in 
                        the Arctic;
                            (iv) promoting responsible natural resource 
                        management and economic development; and
                            (v) countering China's Polar Silk Road 
                        initiative; and
                    (F) examining the possibility of reconvening the 
                Arctic Chiefs of Defense Forum.
    (b) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to recognize only the nations enumerated in subsection 
        (c)(1) as Arctic nations, and to reject all other claims to 
        this status; and
            (2) that the militarization of the Arctic poses a serious 
        threat to Arctic peace and stability, and the interests of 
        United States allies and partners.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Arctic nations.--The term ``Arctic nations'' means the

SEC. 3295. REPORT ON COUNTERING ILLEGAL, UNREPORTED, AND UNREGULATED 
              FISHING IN OCEANIA.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) many countries of the Oceania region depend on 
        commercial tuna fisheries as a critical component of their 
        economies;
            (2) the Government of the People's Republic of China has 
        used its licensed fishing fleet to exert greater influence in 
        Oceania, but at the same time, its licensed fishing fleet is 
        also a major contributor to illegal, unreported, and 
        unregulated fishing (in this section referred to as ``IUU 
        fishing'') activities;
            (3) the sustainability of Oceania's fisheries is threatened 
        by IUU fishing, which depletes both commercially important fish 
        stocks and non-targeted species that help maintain the 
        integrity of the ocean ecosystem;
            (4) in addition, IUU fishing puts pressure on protected 
        species of marine mammals, sea turtles, and sea birds, which 
        also jeopardizes the integrity of the ocean ecosystem;
            (5) further, because IUU fishing goes unrecorded, the loss 
        of biomass compromises scientists' work to assess and model 
        fishery stocks and advise managers on sustainable catch levels;
            (6) beyond the damage to living marine resources, IUU 
        fishing also contributes directly to illegal activity in the 
        Oceania region, such as food fraud, smuggling, and human 
        trafficking;
            (7) current approaches to IUU fishing enforcement rely on 
        established methods, such as vessel monitoring systems, 
        logbooks maintained by government fisheries enforcement 
        authorities to record the catches landed by fishing vessels, 
        and corroborating data on catches hand-collected by human 
        observer programs;
            (8) such established methods are imperfect because--
                    (A) vessels can turn off monitoring systems and 
                unlicensed vessels do not use them; and
                    (B) observer coverage is thin and subject to human 
                error and corruption;
            (9) maritime domain awareness technology solutions for 
        vessel monitoring have gained credibility in recent years and 
        include systems such as observing instruments deployed on 
        satellites, crewed and uncrewed air and surface systems, 
        aircraft, and surface vessels, as well as electronic monitoring 
        systems on fishing vessels;
            (10) maritime domain awareness technologies hold the 
        promise of significantly augmenting the current IUU fishing 
        enforcement capacities; and
            (11) maritime domain awareness technologies offer an avenue 
        for addressing key United States national interests, including 
        those interests related to--
                    (A) increasing bilateral diplomatic ties with key 
                allies and partners in the Oceania region;
                    (B) countering illicit trafficking in arms, 
                narcotics, and human beings associated with IUU 
                fishing;
                    (C) advancing security, long-term growth, and 
                development in the Oceania region;
                    (D) supporting ocean conservation objectives;
                    (E) reducing food insecurity; and
                    (F) countering attempts by the Government of the 
                People's Republic of China to grow its influence in the 
                Oceania region.
    (b) Report Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in 
        consultation with the Administrator of the National Oceanic and 
        Atmospheric Administration, the Commandant of the Coast Guard, 
        and the Secretary of Defense, shall submit to the appropriate 
        congressional committees a report assessing the use of advanced 
        maritime domain awareness technology systems to combat IUU 
        fishing in Oceania.
            (2) Elements.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall 
        include--
                    (A) a review of the effectiveness of existing 
                monitoring technologies, including electronic 
                monitoring systems, to combat IUU fishing;
                    (B) recommendations for effectively integrating 
                effective monitoring technologies into a Oceania-wide 
                strategy for IUU fishing enforcement;
                    (C) an assessment and recommendations for the 
                secure and reliable processing of data from such 
                monitoring technologies, including the security and 
                verification issues;
                    (D) the technical and financial capacity of 
                countries of the Oceania region to deploy and maintain 
                large-scale use of maritime domain awareness 
                technological systems for the purposes of combating IUU 
                fishing and supporting fisheries resource management;
                    (E) a review of the technical and financial 
                capacity of regional organizations and international 
                structures to support countries of the Oceania region 
                in the deployment and maintenance of large-scale use of 
                maritime domain awareness technology systems for the 
                purposes of combating IUU fishing and supporting 
                fisheries resource management;
                    (F) an evaluation of the utility of using foreign 
                assistance, security assistance, and development 
                assistance provided by the United States to countries 
                of the Oceania region to support the large-scale 
                deployment and operations of maritime domain awareness 
                systems to increase maritime security across the 
                region; and
                    (G) an assessment of the role of large-scale 
                deployment and operations of maritime domain awareness 
                systems throughout Oceania to supporting United States 
                economic and national security interests in the Oceania 
                region, including efforts related to countering IUU 
                fishing, improving maritime security, and countering 
                malign foreign influence.

SEC. 3296. OCEANIA PEACE CORPS PARTNERSHIPS.

    (a) In General.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of the Peace Corps shall submit to 
Congress a report on strategies to reasonably and safely expand the 
number of Peace Corps volunteers in Oceania, with the goals of--

                Oceania; and
                    (C) to increase transportation infrastructure in

SEC. 3308. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON TREATMENT OF UYGHURS AND OTHER ETHNIC 
              MINORITIES IN THE XINJIANG UYGHUR AUTONOMOUS REGION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Uyghurs are one of several predominantly Muslim 
        Turkic groups living in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region 
        (XUAR) in the northwest of the People's Republic of China 
        (PRC).
            (2) Following Uyghur demonstrations and unrest in 2009 and 
        clashes with government security personnel and other violent 
        incidents in subsequent years, PRC leaders sought to 
        ``stabilize'' the XUAR through large-scale arrests and extreme 
        security measures, under the pretext of combatting alleged 
        terrorism, religious extremism, and ethnic separatism.
            (3) In May 2014, the PRC launched its ``Strike Hard Against 
        Violent Extremism'' campaign, which placed further restrictions 
        on and facilitated additional human rights violations against 
        minorities in the XUAR under the pretext of fighting terrorism.
            (4) In August 2016, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Politburo 
        member Chen Quanguo, former Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) Party 
        Secretary, known for overseeing intensifying security 
        operations and human rights abuses in the TAR, was appointed as 
        Party Secretary of the XUAR.
            (5) Beginning in 2017, XUAR authorities have sought to 
        forcibly ``assimilate'' Uyghurs and other Turkic minorities 
        into Chinese society through a policy of cultural erasure known 
        as ``Sinicization''.
            (6) Since 2018, credible reporting including from the BBC, 
        France24, and the New York Times has shown that the Government 
        of the PRC has built mass internment camps in the XUAR, which 
        it calls ``vocational training'' centers, and detained Uyghurs 
        and other groups in them and other facilities.
            (7) Since 2015, XUAR authorities have arbitrarily detained 
        an estimated 1,500,000 Uyghurs--12.5 percent of the XUAR's 
        official Uyghur population of 12,000,000--and a smaller number 
        of other ethnic minorities in the ``vocational training'' 
        centers and other detention and pre-detention facilities.
            (8) In 2017, the XUAR accounted for less than two percent 
        of the PRC's total population but 21 percent of all arrests in 
        China.
            (9) The Atlantic, Radio Free Asia, and other sources have 
        revealed that detainees are forced to renounce many of their 
        Islamic beliefs and customs and repudiate Uyghur culture, 
        language, and identity.
            (10) Investigations by Human Rights Watch and other human 
        rights organizations have documented how detainees are subject 
        to political indoctrination, forced labor, crowded and 
        unsanitary conditions, involuntary biometric data collection, 
        both medical neglect and intrusive medical interventions, food 
        and water deprivation, beatings, sexual violence, and torture.
            (11) Research by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute 
        suggests that, since late 2019, many detainees have been placed 
        in higher security facilities and convicted of formal crimes.
            (12) Human Rights Watch has reported that the PRC uses data 
        collection programs, including facial recognition technology, 
        to surveil Uyghurs in the XUAR and to identify individuals whom 
        authorities may detain.
            (13) PRC authorities have placed countless children whose 
        parents are detained or in exile in state-run institutions and 
        boarding schools without the consent of their parents.
            (14) New York Times reporting revealed that numerous local 
        PRC officials who did not agree with the policies carried out 
        in XUAR have been fired and imprisoned.
            (15) Associated Press reporting documented widespread and 
        systemic efforts by PRC authorities to force Uyghur women to 
        take contraceptives or to subject them to sterilization or 
        abortion, threatening to detain those who do not comply.
            (16) PRC authorities prohibit family members and advocates 
        inside and outside China from having regular communications 
        with relatives and friends imprisoned in the XUAR, such as 
        journalist and entrepreneur Ekpar Asat.
            (17) PRC authorities have imposed pervasive restrictions on 
        the peaceful practice of Islam in the XUAR, to the extent that 
        Human Rights Watch asserts the PRC ``has effectively outlawed 
        the practice of Islam''.
            (18) Individuals who are not detained in camps have been 
        forced to attend political indoctrination sessions, subjected 
        to movement restrictions, mass surveillance systems, 
        involuntary biometric data collection, and other human rights 
        abuses.
            (19) International media, nongovernmental organizations, 
        scholars, families, and survivors have reported on the systemic 
        nature of many of these abuses.
            (20) On June 26, 2020, a group of 50 independent United 
        Nations experts jointly expressed alarm over China's 
        deteriorating human rights record, including its repression in 
        Xinjiang, and called on the international community ``to act 
        collectively and decisively to ensure China respects human 
        rights and abides by its international obligations''.
            (21) On October 6, 2020, 39 United Nations member countries 
        issued a public statement condemning human rights violations by 
        PRC authorities and calling on the PRC to allow the United 
        Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights unfettered access to 
        Xinjiang.
            (22) The United States Congress passed the Uyghur Human 
        Rights Policy Act of 2020 (Public Law 116-145).
            (23) The United States Congress passed the Global Magnitsky 
        Human Rights Accountability Act (subtitle F of title XII of 
        Public Law 114-328; 22 U.S.C. 2656 note), which has been used 
        to sanction PRC officials and entities for their activities in 
        the XUAR.
            (24) The United States Government has implemented 
        additional targeted restrictions on trade with Xinjiang and 
        imposed visa and economic sanctions on PRC officials and 
        entities for their activities in the XUAR.
            (25) The United States Government has documented human 
        rights abuses and violations of individual freedoms in the 
        XUAR, including in the 2019 Department of State Report on 
        International Religious Freedom.
            (26) On January 19, 2021, then-Secretary of State Michael 
        Pompeo ``determined that the PRC, under the direction and 
        control of the CCP, has committed genocide against the 
        predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious 
        minority groups in Xinjiang''.
            (27) On January 19, 2021, during his confirmation hearing, 
        Secretary of State Antony Blinken testified that ``forcing men, 
        women, and children into concentration camps, trying to in 
        effect reeducate them to be adherents to the Chinese Communist 
        Party--all of that speaks to an effort to commit genocide''.
            (28) On January 19, 2021, Secretary of the Treasury Janet 
        L. Yellen, during her confirmation hearing, publicly stated 
        that China is guilty of ``horrendous human rights abuses''.
            (29) On January 27, 2021, in response to a question from 
        the press regarding the Uyghurs, Secretary Blinken stated that 
        his ``judgement remains that genocide was committed against the 
        Uyghurs''.
            (30) On March 10, 2021, in response to a question on 
        Xinjiang during his testimony before the Committee on Foreign 
        Affairs of the House of Representatives, Secretary Blinken 
        reiterated, ``We've been clear, and I've been clear, that I see 
        it as genocide, other egregious abuses of human rights, and 
        we'll continue to make that clear.''.
            (31) The 2020 Department of State Country Reports on Human 
        Rights Practices: China states that ``[g]enocide and crimes 
        against humanity occurred during the year against the 
        predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other ethnic and religious 
        minority groups in Xinjiang''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the atrocities committed by the CCP against Uyghurs and 
        other predominantly Muslim Turkic groups in Xinjiang, including 
        forced labor, sexual violence, the internment of over 1,000,000 
        individuals, and other horrific abuses must be condemned;
            (2) the President, the Secretary of State, and the United 
        States Ambassador to the United Nations should speak publicly 
        about the ongoing human rights abuses in the XUAR, including in 
        formal speeches at the United Nations and other international 
        fora;
            (3) the President, the Secretary of State, and the United 
        States Ambassador to the United Nations should appeal to the 
        United Nations Secretary-General to take a more proactive and 
        public stance on the situation in the XUAR, including by 
        supporting calls for an investigation and accountability for 
        individuals and entities involved in abuses against the people 
        of the XUAR;
            (4) the United States should continue to use targeted 
        sanctions and all diplomatic tools available to hold those 
        responsible for the atrocities in Xinjiang to account;
            (5) United States agencies engaged with China on trade, 
        climate, defense, or other bilateral issues should include 
        human rights abuses in the XUAR as a consideration in 
        developing United States policy;
            (6) the United States supports Radio Free Asia Uyghur, the 
        only Uyghur-language news service in the world independent of 
        Chinese government influence; and
            (7) the United States recognizes the repeated requests from 
        the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights for 
        unfettered access to the XUAR and the PRC's refusal to comply, 
        and therefore--
                    (A) PRC authorities must allow unfettered access by 
                the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for 
                Human Rights to the XUAR;
                    (B) the United States should urge collaborative 
                action between the United States Government and 
                international partners to pressure PRC authorities to 
                allow unfettered access to the XUAR;
                    (C) the President, the Secretary of State, and the 
                United States Ambassador to the United Nations should 
                simultaneously outline a strategy to investigate the 
                human rights abuses and crimes that have taken place in 
                the XUAR, collect evidence, and transfer the evidence 
                to a competent court; and
                    (D) United States partners and allies should 
                undertake similar strategies in an effort to build an 
                international investigation outside of the PRC if PRC 
                authorities do not comply with a United Nations 
                investigation in the XUAR.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The People's Republic of China has repeatedly violated 
        its obligations under the Joint Declaration by suppressing the 
        basic rights and freedoms of Hong Kongers.
            (2) On June 30, 2020, the National People's Congress passed 
        a ``National Security Law'' that further erodes Hong Kong's 
        autonomy and enables authorities to suppress dissent.
            (3) The Government of the People's Republic of China 
        continues to utilize the National Security Law to undermine the 
        fundamental rights of the people of Hong Kong through 
        suppression of the freedom of speech, assembly, religion, and 
        the press.
            (4) Article 9 of the National Security Law authorizes 
        unprecedented regulation and supervision of internet activity 
        in Hong Kong, including expanded police powers to force 
        internet service providers to censor content, hand over user 
        information, and block access to platforms.
            (5) On January 13, 2021, the Hong Kong Broadband Network 
        blocked public access to HK Chronicles, a website promoting 
        pro-democracy viewpoints, under the authorities of the National 
        Security Law.
            (6) On February 12, 2021, internet service providers

        Hong Kong were arrested and charged under the National Security 
        Law on the charge of ``conspiracy to commit subversion''.

        the unhindered exchange of information in Hong Kong in advance 
        of any future efforts by the Chinese Communist Party--
                    (A) to suppress internet access;
                    (B) to increase online censorship; or
                    (C) to inhibit online communication and content-

             TITLE IV--INVESTING IN OUR ECONOMIC STATECRAFT

SEC. 3401. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING THE PRC'S 
              INDUSTRIAL POLICY.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The People's Republic of China, at the direction of the 
        Chinese Communist Party, is advancing an ecosystem of 
        anticompetitive economic and industrial policies that--
                    (A) distort global markets;
                    (B) limit innovation;
                    (C) unfairly advantage PRC firms at the expense of 
                the United States and other foreign firms; and
                    (D) unfairly and harmfully prejudice consumer 
                choice.
            (2) Of the extensive and systemic economic and industrial 
        policies pursued by the PRC, the mass subsidization of PRC 
        firms, intellectual property theft, and forced technology 
        transfer are among the most damaging to the global economy.
            (3) Through regulatory interventions and direct financial 
        subsidies, the CCP, for the purposes of advancing national 
        political and economic objectives, directs, coerces, and 
        influences in anti-competitive ways the commercial activities 
        of firms that are directed, financed, influenced, or otherwise 
        controlled by the state, including state-owned enterprises, and 
        ostensibly independent and private Chinese companies, such as 
        technology firms in strategic sectors.
            (4) The PRC Government, at the national and subnational 
        levels, grants special privileges or status to certain PRC 
        firms in key sectors designated as strategic, such as 
        telecommunications, oil, power, aviation, banking, and 
        semiconductors. Enterprises receive special state preferences 
        in the form of favorable loans, tax exemptions, and 
        preferential land access from the CCP.
            (5) The subsidization of PRC companies, as described in 
        paragraphs (3) and (4)--
                    (A) enables these companies to sell goods below 
                market prices, allowing them to outbid and crowd out 
                market-based competitors and thereby pursue global 
                dominance of key sectors;
                    (B) distorts the global market economy by 
                undermining longstanding and generally accepted market-
                based principles of fair competition, leading to 
                barriers to entry and forced exit from the market for 
                foreign or private firms, not only in the PRC, but in 
                markets around the world;
                    (C) creates government-sponsored or supported de 
                facto monopolies, cartels, and other anti-market 
                arrangements in key sectors, limiting or removing 
                opportunities for other firms; and
                    (D) leads to, as a result of the issues described 
                in paragraphs (A) through (C), declines in profits and 
                revenue needed by foreign and private firms for 
                research and development.
            (6) The CCP incentivizes and empowers PRC actors to steal 
        critical technologies and trade secrets from private and 
        foreign competitors operating in the PRC and around the world, 
        particularly in areas that the CCP has identified as critical 
        to advancing PRC objectives. The PRC, as directed by the CCP, 
        also continues to implement anti-competitive regulations, 
        policies, and practices that coerce the handover of technology 
        and other propriety or sensitive data from foreign enterprises 
        to domestic firms in exchange for access to the PRC market.
            (7) Companies in the United States and in foreign countries 
        compete with state-subsidized PRC companies that enjoy the 
        protection and power of the state in third-country markets 
        around the world. The advantages granted to PRC firms, combined 
        with significant restrictions to accessing the PRC market 
        itself, severely hamper the ability of United States and 
        foreign firms to compete, innovate, and pursue the provision of 
        best value to customers. The result is an unbalanced playing 
        field. Such an unsustainable course, if not checked, will over 
        time lead to depressed competition around the world, reduced 
        opportunity, and harm to both producers and consumers.
            (8) As stated in the United States Trade Representative's 
        investigation of the PRC's trade practices under section 301 of 
        the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411), conducted in March 
        2018, ``When U.S. companies are deprived of fair returns on 
        their investment in IP, they are unable to achieve the growth 
        necessary to reinvest in innovation. In this sense, China's 
        technology transfer regime directly burdens the innovation 
        ecosystem that is an engine of economic growth in the United 
        States and similarly-situated economies.''.
            (9) In addition to forced technology transfers described in 
        this subsection, the United States Trade Representative's 
        investigation of the PRC under section 301 of the Trade Act of 
        1974 (19 U.S.C. 2411) also identified requirements that foreign 
        firms license products at less than market value, government-
        directed and government-subsidized acquisition of sensitive 
        technology for strategic purposes, and cyber theft as other key 
        PRC technology and industrial policies that are unreasonable 
        and discriminatory. These policies place at risk United States 
        intellectual property rights, innovation and technological 
        development, and jobs in dozens of industries.
            (10) Other elements of the PRC's ecosystem of industrial 
        policies that harm innovation and distort global markets 
        include--
                    (A) advancement of policies that encourage local 
                production over imports;
                    (B) continuation of policies that favor unique 
                technical standards in use by PRC firms rather than 
                globally accepted standards, which often force foreign 
                firms to alter their products and manufacturing chains 
                to compete;
                    (C) requirements that foreign companies disclose 
                proprietary information to qualify for the adoption of 
                their standards for use in the PRC domestic market; and
                    (D) maintenance of closed procurement processes, 
                which limit participation by foreign firms, including 
                by setting terms that require such firms to use 
                domestic suppliers, transfer know-how to firms in the 
                PRC, and disclose proprietary information.
            (11) The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and associated 
        industry-specific efforts under this initiative, such as the 
        Digital Silk Road, are key vectors to advance the PRC's 
        mercantilist policies and practices globally. The resulting 
        challenges do not only affect United States firms. As the 
        European Chamber of Commerce reported in a January 2020 report, 
        the combination of concessional lending to PRC state-owned 
        enterprises, nontransparent procurement and bidding processes, 
        closed digital standards, and other factors severely limit 
        European and other participation in BRI and make ``competition 
        [with PRC companies] in third-country markets extremely 
        challenging''. This underscores a key objective of BRI, which 
        is to ensure the reliance of infrastructure, digital 
        technologies, and other important goods on PRC supply chains 
        and technical standards.
            (12) On January 9, 2021, the Ministry of Commerce of the 
        PRC issued Order No. 1 of 2021, entitled ``Rules on 
        Counteracting Unjustified Extraterritorial Application of 
        Foreign Legislation and other Measures'', which establishes a 
        blocking regime in response to foreign sanctions on Chinese 
        individuals and entities. That order allows the Government of 
        the PRC to designate specific foreign laws as ``unjustified 
        extraterritorial application of foreign legislation'' and to 
        prohibit compliance with such foreign laws.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the challenges presented by a nonmarket economy like 
        the PRC's economy, which has captured such a large share of 
        global economic exchange, are in many ways unprecedented and 
        require sufficiently elevated and sustained long-term focus and 
        engagement;
            (2) in order to truly address the most detrimental aspects 
        of CCP-directed mercantilist economic strategy, the United 
        States must adopt policies that--
                    (A) expose the full scope and scale of intellectual 
                property theft and mass subsidization of Chinese firms, 
                and the resulting harm to the United States, foreign 
                markets, and the global economy;
                    (B) ensure that PRC companies face costs and 
                consequences for anticompetitive behavior;
                    (C) provide options for affected United States 
                persons to address and respond to unreasonable and 
                discriminatory CCP-directed industrial policies; and
                    (D) strengthen the protection of critical 
                technology and sensitive data, while still fostering an 
                environment that provides incentives for innovation and 
                competition;
            (3) the United States must work with its allies and 
        partners through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
        Development (OECD), the World Trade Organization, and other 
        venues and fora--
                    (A) to reinforce long-standing generally accepted 
                principles of fair competition and market behavior and 
                address the PRC's anticompetitive economic and 
                industrial policies that undermine decades of global 
                growth and innovation;
                    (B) to ensure that the PRC is not granted the same 
                treatment as that of a free-market economy until it 
                ceases the implementation of laws, regulations, 
                policies, and practices that provide unfair advantage 
                to PRC firms in furtherance of national objectives and 
                impose unreasonable, discriminatory, and illegal 
                burdens on market-based international commerce; and
                    (C) to align policies with respect to curbing 
                state-directed subsidization of the private sector, 
                such as advocating for global rules related to 
                transparency and adherence to notification 
                requirements, including through the efforts currently 
                being advanced by the United States, Japan, and the 
                European Union;
            (4) the United States and its allies and partners must 
        collaborate to provide incentives to their respective companies 
        to cooperate in areas such as--
                    (A) advocating for protection of intellectual 
                property rights in markets around the world;
                    (B) fostering open technical standards; and
                    (C) increasing joint investments in overseas 
                markets; and
            (5) the United States should develop policies that--
                    (A) insulate United States entities from PRC 
                pressure against complying with United States laws;
                    (B) counter the potential impact of the blocking 
                regime of the PRC described in subsection (a)(12), 
                including by working with allies and partners of the 
                United States and multilateral institutions; and
                    (C) plan for future actions that the Government of 
                the PRC may take to undermine the lawful application of 
                United States legal authorities, including with respect 
                to the use of sanctions.

                States economic sector or particular company 
                incorporated in the United States to harm; or
                    (B) an act or government policy of involuntary or 
                coerced technology transfer of intellectual property 
                ultimately owned by a company incorporated in the

                at the expense of foreign market participants;
                    (B) shield centrally administered, state-owned

                  TITLE V--ENSURING STRATEGIC SECURITY

SEC. 3501. FINDINGS ON STRATEGIC SECURITY AND ARMS CONTROL.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States and the PRC have both made 
        commitments to advancing strategic security through enforceable 
        arms control and non-proliferation agreements as states parties 
        to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, done 
        at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968.
            (2) The United States has long taken tangible steps to seek 
        effective, verifiable, and enforceable arms control and non-
        proliferation agreements that support United States and allied 
        security by--
                    (A) controlling the spread of nuclear materials and 
                technology;
                    (B) placing limits on the production, stockpiling, 
                and deployment of nuclear weapons;
                    (C) decreasing misperception and miscalculation; 
                and
                    (D) avoiding destabilizing nuclear arms 
                competition.
            (3) In May 2019, Director of the Defense Intelligence 
        Agency Lieutenant General Robert Ashley stated, ``China is 
        likely to at least double the size of its nuclear stockpile in 
        the course of implementing the most rapid expansion and 
        diversification of its nuclear arsenal in China's history.''. 
        The PLA is building a full triad of modernized fixed and mobile 
        ground-based launchers and new capabilities for nuclear-armed 
        bombers and submarine-launched ballistic missiles.
            (4) In June 2020, the Department of State raised concerns 
        in its annual ``Adherence to and Compliance with Arms Control, 
        Nonproliferation, and Disarmament Agreements and Commitments'' 
        report to Congress that the PRC is not complying with the 
        ``zero-yield'' nuclear testing ban and accused the PRC of 
        ``blocking the flow of data from the monitoring stations'' in 
        China.
            (5) The Department of Defense 2020 Report on Military and 
        Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China 
        states that the PRC ``intends to increase peacetime readiness 
        of its nuclear forces by moving to a launch on warning posture 
        with an expanded silo-based force''.
            (6) The Department of Defense report also states that, over 
        the next decade, the PRC's nuclear stockpile--currently 
        estimated in the low 200s--is projected to least double in size 
        as the PRC expands and modernizes its nuclear force.
            (7) The PRC is conducting research on its first potential 
        early warning radar, with technical cooperation from Russia. 
        This radar could indicate that the PRC is moving to a launch-on 
        warning posture.
            (8) The PRC plans to use its increasingly capable space, 
        cyber, and electronic warfare capabilities against United 
        States early warning systems and critical infrastructure in a 
        crisis scenario. This poses great risk to strategic security, 
        as it could lead to inadvertent escalation.
            (9) The PRC's nuclear expansion comes as a part of a 
        massive modernization of the PLA which, combined with the PLA's 
        aggressive actions, has increasingly destabilized the Indo-
        Pacific region.
            (10) The PLA Rocket Force (PLARF), which was elevated in 
        2015 to become a separate branch within the PLA, has formed 11 
        new missile brigades since May 2017, some of which are capable 
        of both conventional and nuclear strikes. Unlike the United 
        States, which separates its conventional strike and nuclear 
        capabilities, the PLARF appears to not only co-locate 
        conventional and nuclear forces, including dual-use missiles 
        like the DF-26, but to task the same unit with both nuclear and 
        conventional missions. Such intermingling could lead to 
        inadvertent escalation in a crisis. The United States Defense 
        Intelligence Agency determined in March 2020 that the PLA 
        tested more ballistic missiles than the rest of the world 
        combined in 2019.
            (11) A January 2021 report from the Institute for Defense 
        Analysis found that many United States and international 
        observers viewed China's no first-use policy with skepticism, 
        especially in the wake of the expansion and modernization of 
        its nuclear capabilities.
            (12) The long-planned United States nuclear modernization 
        program will not increase the United States nuclear weapons 
        stockpile, predates China's conventional military and nuclear 
        expansion, and is not an arms race against China.
            (13) The United States extended nuclear deterrence--
                    (A) provides critical strategic security around the 
                world;
                    (B) is an essential element of United States 
                military alliances; and
                    (C) serves a vital non-proliferation function.
            (14) As a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation 
        of Nuclear Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 
        1, 1968, the PRC is obligated under Article Six of the treaty 
        to pursue arms control negotiations in good faith.
            (15) The United States has, on numerous occasions, called 
        on the PRC to participate in strategic arms control 
        negotiations, but the PRC has thus far declined.
            (16) The Governments of Japan, the United Kingdom, Poland, 
        Slovenia, Denmark, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, the 
        Netherlands, Romania, Austria, Montenegro, Ukraine, Slovakia, 
        Spain, North Macedonia, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Croatia, 
        and Albania, as well as the Deputy Secretary General of the 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization, have all encouraged the PRC 
        to join arms control discussions.

SEC. 3502. COOPERATION ON A STRATEGIC NUCLEAR DIALOGUE.

    (a) Statement of Policy.--It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to pursue, in coordination with United States allies, 
        arms control negotiations and sustained and regular engagement 
        with the PRC--
                    (A) to enhance understanding of each other's 
                respective nuclear policies, doctrine, and 
                capabilities;
                    (B) to improve transparency; and
                    (C) to help manage the risks of miscalculation and 
                misperception;
            (2) to formulate a strategy to engage the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China on relevant bilateral issues that 
        lays the groundwork for bringing the People's Republic of China 
        into an arms control framework, including--
                    (A) fostering bilateral dialogue on arms control 
                leading to the convening of bilateral strategic 
                security talks;
                    (B) negotiating norms for outer space;
                    (C) developing pre-launch notification regimes 
                aimed at reducing nuclear miscalculation; and
                    (D) expanding lines of communication between both 
                governments for the purposes of reducing the risks of 
                conventional war and increasing transparency;
            (3) to pursue relevant capabilities in coordination with 
        our allies and partners to ensure the security of United States 
        and allied interests in the face of the PRC's military 
        modernization and expansion, including--
                    (A) ground-launched cruise and ballistic missiles;
                    (B) integrated air and missile defense;
                    (C) hypersonic missiles;
                    (D) intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance;
                    (E) space-based capabilities;
                    (F) cyber capabilities; and
                    (G) command, control, and communications;
            (4) to maintain sufficient force structure, posture, and 
        capabilities to provide extended nuclear deterrence to United 
        States allies and partners;
            (5) to maintain appropriate missile defense capabilities to 
        protect against threats to the United States homeland and our 
        forces across the theater from rogue intercontinental ballistic 
        missiles from the Indo-Pacific region; and
            (6) to ensure that the United States declaratory policy 
        reflects the requirements of extended deterrence, to both 
        assure allies and to preserve its non-proliferation benefits.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) in the midst of growing competition between the United 
        States and the PRC, it is in the interest of both nations to 
        cooperate in reducing risks of conventional and nuclear 
        escalation;
            (2) a physical, cyber, electronic, or any other PLA attack 
        on United States early warning satellites, other portions of 
        the nuclear command and control enterprise, or critical 
        infrastructure poses a high risk to inadvertent but rapid 
        escalation;
            (3) the United States and its allies should promote 
        international norms on military operations in space, the 
        employment of cyber capabilities, and the military use of 
        artificial intelligence, as an element of risk reduction 
        regarding nuclear command and control; and
            (4) United States allies and partners should share the 
        burden of promoting and protecting such norms by voting against 
        the PRC's proposals regarding the weaponization of space, 
        highlighting unsafe behavior by the PRC that violates 
        international norms, such as in rendezvous and proximity 
        operations, and promoting responsible behavior in space and all 
        other domains.

        on ballistic, hypersonic glide, and cruise missiles, 
        conventional forces, nuclear, space, and cyberspace issues, as 
        well as other new strategic domains, which could reduce the 
        likelihood of war, limit escalation if a conflict were to 
        occur, and constrain a destabilizing arms race in the Indo-
        Pacific;
            (2) how the United States Government can incentivize the 
        Government of the People's Republic of China to engage in a

SEC. 3504. COUNTERING THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA'S PROLIFERATION OF 
              BALLISTIC MISSILES AND NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY TO THE MIDDLE 
              EAST.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The People's Republic of China became a full 
        participant of the Nuclear Suppliers Group in 2004, committing 
        it to apply a strong presumption of denial in exporting 
        nuclear-related items that a foreign country could divert to a 
        nuclear weapons program.
            (2) The People's Republic of China also committed to the 
        United States, in November 2000, to abide by the foundational 
        principles of the 1987 Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) 
        to not ``assist, in any way, any country in the development of 
        ballistic missiles that can be used to deliver nuclear weapons 
        (i.e., missiles capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 
        kilograms to a distance of at least 300 kilometers)''.
            (3) The 2020 Department of State Report on the Adherence to 
        and Compliance with Arms Control, Nonproliferation, and 
        Disarmament Agreements and Commitments found that the People's 
        Republic of China ``continued to supply MTCR-controlled goods 
        to missile programs of proliferation concern in 2019'' and that 
        the United States imposed sanctions on nine Chinese entities 
        for covered missile transfers to Iran.
            (4) A June 5, 2019, press report indicated that the 
        People's Republic of China allegedly provided assistance to 
        Saudi Arabia in the development of a ballistic missile 
        facility, which if confirmed, would violate the purpose of the 
        MTCR and run contrary to the longstanding United States policy 
        priority to prevent weapons of mass destruction proliferation 
        in the Middle East.
            (5) The Arms Export and Control Act of 1976 (Public Law 93-
        329) requires the President to sanction any foreign person or 
        government who knowingly ``exports, transfers, or otherwise 
        engages in the trade of any MTCR equipment or technology'' to a 
        country that does not adhere to the MTCR.
            (6) The People's Republic of China concluded two nuclear 
        cooperation agreements with Saudi Arabia in 2012 and 2017, 
        respectively, which may facilitate the People's Republic of 
        China's bid to build two reactors in Saudi Arabia to generate 
        2.9 Gigawatt-electric (GWe) of electricity.
            (7) On August 4, 2020, a press report revealed the alleged 
        existence of a previously undisclosed uranium yellowcake 
        extraction facility in Saudi Arabia allegedly constructed with 
        the assistance of the People's Republic of China, which if 
        confirmed, would indicate significant progress by Saudi Arabia 
        in developing the early stages of the nuclear fuel cycle that 
        precede uranium enrichment.
            (8) Saudi Arabia's outdated Small Quantities Protocol and 
        its lack of an in-force Additional Protocol to its 
        International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Comprehensive 
        Safeguards Agreement severely curtails IAEA inspections, which 
        has led the Agency to call upon Saudi Arabia to either rescind 
        or update its Small Quantities Protocol.
    (b) MTCR Transfers.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the appropriate 
committees of Congress a written determination, and any documentation 
to support that determination detailing--
            (1) whether any foreign person in the People's Republic of 
        China knowingly exported, transferred, or engaged in trade of 
        any item designated under Category I of the MTCR Annex to any 
        foreign person in the previous three fiscal years; and
            (2) the sanctions the President has imposed or intends to 
        impose pursuant to section 11B(b) of the Export Administration 
        Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. 4612(b)) against any foreign person who 
        knowingly engaged in the export, transfer, or trade of that 
        item or items.
    (c) The People's Republic of China's Nuclear Fuel Cycle 
Cooperation.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the enactment of 
this Act, the President shall submit to the appropriate committees of 
Congress a report detailing--
            (1) whether any foreign person in the People's Republic of 
        China engaged in cooperation with any other foreign person in 
        the previous three fiscal years in the construction of any 
        nuclear-related fuel cycle facility or activity that has not 
        been notified to the IAEA and would be subject to complementary 
        access if an Additional Protocol was in force; and
            (2) the policy options required to prevent and respond to 
        any future effort by the People's Republic of China to export 
        to any foreign person an item classified as ``plants for the 
        separation of isotopes of uranium'' or ``plants for the 
        reprocessing of irradiated nuclear reactor fuel elements'' 
        under Part 110 of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission export 
        licensing authority.
    (d) Form of Report.--The determination required under subsection 
(b) and the report required under subsection (c) shall be unclassified 
with a classified annex.
    (e) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) The term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--
                    (A) the Select Committee on Intelligence of the 
                Senate;
                    (B) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the 
                Senate;

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Build America, Buy America 
Act''.

               PART I--BUY AMERICA SOURCING REQUIREMENTS

SEC. 4111. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) the United States must make significant investments to 
        install, upgrade, or replace the public works infrastructure of 
        the United States;
            (2) with respect to investments in the infrastructure of 
        the United States, taxpayers expect that their public works 
        infrastructure will be produced in the United States by 
        American workers;
            (3) United States taxpayer dollars invested in public 
        infrastructure should not be used to reward companies that have 
        moved their operations, investment dollars, and jobs to foreign 
        countries or foreign factories, particularly those that do not 
        share or openly flout the commitments of the United States to 
        environmental, worker, and workplace safety protections;
            (4) in procuring materials for public works projects, 
        entities using taxpayer-financed Federal assistance should give 
        a commonsense procurement preference for the materials and 
        products produced by companies and workers in the United States 
        in accordance with the high ideals embodied in the 
        environmental, worker, workplace safety, and other regulatory 
        requirements of the United States;
            (5) common construction materials used in public works 
        infrastructure projects, including steel, iron, manufactured 
        products, non-ferrous metals, plastic and polymer-based 
        products (including polyvinylchloride, composite building 
        materials, and polymers used in fiber optic cables), concrete 
        and other aggregates, glass (including optic glass), lumber, 
        and drywall are not adequately covered by a domestic content 
        procurement preference, thus limiting the impact of taxpayer 
        purchases to enhance supply chains in the United States;
            (6) the benefits of domestic content procurement 
        preferences extend beyond economics;
            (7) by incentivizing domestic manufacturing, domestic 
        content procurement preferences reinvest tax dollars in 
        companies and processes using the highest labor and 
        environmental standards in the world;
            (8) strong domestic content procurement preference policies 
        act to prevent shifts in production to countries that rely on 
        production practices that are significantly less energy 
        efficient and far more polluting than those in the United 
        States;
            (9) for over 75 years, Buy America and other domestic 
        content procurement preference laws have been part of the 
        United States procurement policy, ensuring that the United 
        States can build and rebuild the infrastructure of the United 
        States with high-quality American-made materials;
            (10) before the date of enactment of this Act, a domestic 
        content procurement preference requirement may not apply, may 
        apply only to a narrow scope of products and materials, or may 
        be limited by waiver with respect to many infrastructure 
        programs, which necessitates a review of such programs, 
        including programs for roads, highways, and bridges, public 
        transportation, dams, ports, harbors, and other maritime 
        facilities, intercity passenger and freight railroads, freight 
        and intermodal facilities, airports, water systems, including 
        drinking water and wastewater systems, electrical transmission 
        facilities and systems, utilities, broadband infrastructure, 
        and buildings and real property;
            (11) Buy America laws create demand for domestically 
        produced goods, helping to sustain and grow domestic 
        manufacturing and the millions of jobs domestic manufacturing 
        supports throughout product supply chains;
            (12) as of the date of enactment of this Act, domestic 
        content procurement preference policies apply to all Federal 
        Government procurement and to various Federal-aid 
        infrastructure programs;
            (13) a robust domestic manufacturing sector is a vital 
        component of the national security of the United States;
            (14) as more manufacturing operations of the United States 
        have moved offshore, the strength and readiness of the defense 
        industrial base of the United States has been diminished; and
            (15) domestic content procurement preference laws--
                    (A) are fully consistent with the international 
                obligations of the United States; and
                    (B) together with the government procurements to 
                which the laws apply, are important levers for ensuring 
                that United States manufacturers can access the 
                government procurement markets of the trading partners 
                of the United States.

        sufficient and reasonably available quantities or of a 
        satisfactory quality; or
            (3) the inclusion of iron, steel, manufactured products, or 
        construction materials produced in the United States will 
        increase the cost of the overall project by more than 25 
        percent.
    (c) Written Justification.--Before issuing a waiver under 
subsection (b), the head of the Federal agency shall--
            (1) make publicly available in an easily accessible 
        location on a website designated by the Office of Management 
        and Budget and on the website of the Federal agency a detailed 
        written explanation for the proposed determination to issue the 
        waiver; and
            (2) provide a period of not less than 15 days for public 
        comment on the proposed waiver.
    (d) Automatic Sunset on Waivers of General Applicability.--
            (1) In general.--A general applicability waiver issued 
        under subsection (b) shall expire not later than 2 years after 
        the date on which the waiver is issued.
            (2) Reissuance.--The head of a Federal agency may reissue a 
        general applicability waiver only after--
                    (A) publishing in the Federal Register a notice 
                that--
                            (i) describes the justification for 
                        reissuing a general applicability waiver; and
                            (ii) requests public comments for a period 
                        of not less than 30 days; and
                    (B) publishing in the Federal Register a second 
                notice that--
                            (i) responds to the public comments 
                        received in response to the first notice; and
                            (ii) provides the final decision on whether 
                        the general applicability waiver will be 
                        reissued.
    (e) Consistency With International Agreements.--This section shall 
be applied in a manner consistent with United States obligations under 
international agreements.

                under section 4113(c); and
                    (B) to assist in applying new domestic content 
                procurement preferences under section 4114; and
            (2) if necessary, amend subtitle A of title 2, Code of 
        Federal Regulations (or successor regulations), to ensure that

        materials.
            (2) Considerations.--In issuing standards under paragraph 
        (1), the Director shall--
                    (A) ensure that the standards require that each 
                manufacturing process required for the manufacture of 
                the construction material and the inputs of the 
                construction material occurs in the United States; and
                    (B) take into consideration and seek to maximize 
                the direct and indirect jobs benefited or created in 
                the production of the construction material.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Director of the Office of Management and 
Budget (``Director''), acting through the Administrator for Federal 
Procurement Policy and, in consultation with the Federal Acquisition 
Regulatory Council, shall promulgate final regulations or other policy 
or management guidance, as appropriate, to standardize and simplify how 
Federal agencies comply with, report on, and enforce the Buy American 
Act. The regulations or other policy or management guidance shall 
include, at a minimum, the following:
            (1) Guidelines for Federal agencies to determine, for the 
        purposes of applying sections 8302(a) and 8303(b)(3) of title 
        41, United States Code, the circumstances under which the 
        acquisition of articles, materials, or supplies mined, 
        produced, or manufactured in the United States is inconsistent 
        with the public interest.
            (2) Guidelines to ensure Federal agencies base 
        determinations of non-availability on appropriate 
        considerations, including anticipated project delays and lack 
        of substitutable articles, materials, and supplies mined, 
        produced, or manufactured in the United States, when making 
        determinations of non-availability under section 8302(a)(1) of 
        title 41, United States Code.
            (3)(A) Uniform procedures for each Federal agency to make 
        publicly available, in an easily identifiable location on the 
        website of the agency, and within the following time periods, 
        the following information:
                    (i) A written description of the circumstances in 
                which the head of the agency may waive the requirements 
                of the Buy American Act.
                    (ii) Each waiver made by the head of the agency 
                within 30 days after making such waiver, including a 
                justification with sufficient detail to explain the 
                basis for the waiver.
            (B) The procedures established under this paragraph shall 
        ensure that the head of an agency, in consultation with the 
        head of the Made in America Office established under section 
        4123(a), may limit the publication of classified information, 
        trade secrets, or other information that could damage the 
        United States.
            (4) Guidelines for Federal agencies to ensure that a 
        project is not disaggregated for purposes of avoiding the 
        applicability of the requirements under the Buy American Act.
            (5) An increase to the price preferences for domestic end 
        products and domestic construction materials.
            (6) Amending the definitions of ``domestic end product'' 
        and ``domestic construction material'' to ensure that iron and 
        steel products are, to the greatest extent possible, made with 
        domestic components.
    (b) Guidelines Relating to Waivers.--
            (1) Inconsistency with public interest.--
                    (A) In general.--With respect to the guidelines 
                developed under subsection (a)(1), the Administrator 
                shall seek to minimize waivers related to contract 
                awards that--
                            (i) result in a decrease in employment in 
                        the United States, including employment among 
                        entities that manufacture the articles, 
                        materials, or supplies; or
                            (ii) result in awarding a contract that 
                        would decrease domestic employment.
                    (B) Covered employment.--For purposes of 
                subparagraph (A), employment refers to positions 
                directly involved in the manufacture of articles, 
                materials, or supplies, and does not include positions 
                related to management, research and development, or 
                engineering and design.
            (2) Assessment on use of dumped or subsidized foreign 
        products.--
                    (A) In general.--To the extent otherwise permitted 
                by law, before granting a waiver in the public interest 
                to the guidelines developed under subsection (a)(1) 
                with respect to a product sourced from a foreign 
                country, a Federal agency shall assess whether a 
                significant portion of the cost advantage of the 
                product is the result of the use of dumped steel, iron, 
                or manufactured goods or the use of injuriously 
                subsidized steel, iron, or manufactured goods.
                    (B) Consultation.--The Federal agency conducting 
                the assessment under subparagraph (A) shall consult 
                with the International Trade Administration in making 
                the assessment if the agency considers such 
                consultation to be helpful.
                    (C) Use of findings.--The Federal agency conducting 
                the assessment under subparagraph (A) shall integrate 
                any findings from the assessment into its waiver 
                determination.
    (c) Sense of Congress on Increasing Domestic Content 
Requirements.--It is the sense of Congress that the Federal Acquisition 
Regulatory Council should amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation to 
increase the domestic content requirements for domestic end products 
and domestic construction material to 75 percent, or, in the event of 
no qualifying offers, 60 percent.
    (d) Definition of End Product Manufactured in the United States.--
Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment of this Act, the 
Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council shall amend part 25 of the 
Federal Acquisition Regulation to provide a definition for ``end 
product manufactured in the United States,'' including guidelines to 
ensure that manufacturing processes involved in production of the end 
product occur domestically.

                    Subtitle C--Make PPE in America

SEC. 4151. SHORT TITLE.

    This subtitle may be cited as the ``Make PPE in America Act''.

SEC. 4152. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed the vulnerability of 
        the United States supply chains for, and lack of domestic 
        production of, personal protective equipment (PPE).
            (2) The United States requires a robust, secure, and wholly 
        domestic PPE supply chain to safeguard public health and 
        national security.
            (3) Issuing a strategy that provides the government's 
        anticipated needs over the next three years will enable 
        suppliers to assess what changes, if any, are needed in their 
        manufacturing capacity to meet expected demands.
            (4) In order to foster a domestic PPE supply chain, United 
        States industry needs a strong and consistent demand signal 
        from the Federal Government providing the necessary certainty 
        to expand production capacity investment in the United States.
            (5) In order to effectively incentivize investment in the 
        United States and the re-shoring of manufacturing, long-term 
        contracts must be no shorter than three years in duration.
            (6) To accomplish this aim, the United States should seek 
        to ensure compliance with its international obligations, such 
        as its commitments under the World Trade Organization's 
        Agreement on Government Procurement and its free trade 
        agreements, including by invoking any relevant exceptions to 
        those agreements, especially those related to national security 
        and public health.
            (7) The United States needs a long-term investment strategy 
        for the domestic production of PPE items critical to the United 
        States national response to a public health crisis, including 
        the COVID-19 pandemic.

                      TITLE I--FINANCIAL SERVICES

SEC. 5101. FINDINGS ON TRANSPARENCY AND DISCLOSURE; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) More than 2,000,000 corporations, limited liability 
        companies, and other similar entities are formed under the laws 
        of the States each year and some of those 2,000,000 entities 
        are formed by persons outside of the United States, including 
        by persons in the People's Republic of China.
            (2) Most or all States do not require information about the 
        beneficial owners of the corporations, limited liability 
        companies, or other similar entities formed under the laws of 
        the State.
            (3) Malign actors seek to conceal their ownership of 
        corporations, limited liability companies, or other similar 
        entities in the United States to facilitate illicit activity, 
        including money laundering, the financing of terrorism, 
        proliferation financing, serious tax fraud, human and drug 
        trafficking, counterfeiting, piracy, securities fraud, 
        financial fraud, economic espionage, theft of intellectual 
        property, and acts of foreign corruption, which harm the 
        national security interests of the United States and allies of 
        the United States.
            (4) National security, intelligence, and law enforcement 
        investigations have consistently been impeded by an inability 
        to reliably and promptly obtain information identifying the 
        persons that ultimately own corporations, limited liability 
        companies, or other similar entities suspected of engaging in 
        illicit activity, as documented in reports and testimony by 
        officials from the Department of Justice, the Department of 
        Homeland Security, the Department of the Treasury, the 
        Government Accountability Office, and other agencies.
            (5) In the National Strategy for Combating Terrorist and 
        Other Illicit Financing, issued in 2020, the Department of the 
        Treasury found the following: ``Misuse of legal entities to 
        hide a criminal beneficial owner or illegal source of funds 
        continues to be a common, if not the dominant, feature of 
        illicit finance schemes, especially those involving money 
        laundering, predicate offences, tax evasion, and proliferation 
        financing.''.
            (6) Federal legislation, including the Anti-Money 
        Laundering Act of 2020 (division F of Public Law 116-283) and 
        the Corporate Transparency Act (title LXIV of division F of 
        Public Law 116-283), combating the crime of money laundering 
        and providing for the collection of beneficial ownership 
        information by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the 
        Department of the Treasury (referred to in this section as 
        ``FinCEN'') with respect to corporations, limited liability 
        companies, or other similar entities formed under the laws of 
        the States has recently been enacted to--
                    (A) set a clear Federal standard for incorporation 
                practices;
                    (B) better enable critical national security, 
                intelligence, and law enforcement efforts to identify 
                and counter money laundering, the financing of 
                terrorism, and other illicit activity; and
                    (C) bring the United States into compliance with 
                international standards with respect to anti-money 
                laundering and countering the financing of terrorism.
            (7) Providing beneficial ownership information to FinCEN is 
        especially important in cases in which foreign firms, including 
        those in the People's Republic of China or subject to the 
        jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China, seek to acquire 
        United States firms and the valuable intellectual property of 
        those firms in a manner that poses a threat to the national 
        security of the United States.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of the Treasury should implement the Anti-Money Laundering 
Act of 2020 (division F of Public Law 116-283), including the Corporate 
Transparency Act (title LXIV of division F of Public Law 116-283), 
within the timelines required under those Acts, including the elements 
of those Acts designed to enhance the ability of financial services 
providers to adopt and implement anti-money laundering best practices, 
mitigate burdens on small businesses, ensure the security of beneficial 
ownership information as provided for by those Acts, and address 
specific concerns relating to abuses of anonymous shell companies by 
Chinese entities and the Government of the People's Republic of China.

            (2) recommendations to the committees on potential 
        amendments to antitrust and competition laws in the United 
        States that would strengthen the ability of United States 
        antitrust enforcement agencies to bring actions against 
        anticompetitive business practices by Chinese companies.
    (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this section, 
the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--

    (a) In General.--Section 6507 of the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 
2020 (division F of Public Law 116-283) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a)--
                    (A) in paragraph (3), by striking ``; and'' and 
                inserting a semicolon;
                    (B) in paragraph (4), by striking the period at the 
                end and inserting ``; and''; and

        risks may contribute to corruption involving Chinese firms and 
        a strategy to combat such corruption.''; and
            (2) in subsection (b), by inserting ``and corruption'' 
        after ``activities''.
    (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (a) shall 
take effect as if included in the enactment of the Anti-Money 
Laundering Act of 2020 (division F of Public Law 116-283).

              CORPORATE CODE OF CONDUCT FOR COUNTERING MALIGN INFLUENCE 
              IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR.

    It is the policy of the United States--

        Chinese investment in the United States; and
            (2) recommendations for legislative or administrative 
        action that would be necessary to ensure that, on a reciprocal, 
        sector-by-sector basis, there is an equivalent level of market 
        access for United States investors to the market of the 
        People's Republic of China as there is for Chinese investors to 
        the market of the United States.

                citizens and residents of the United States from such 
                entities that sequence, analyze, collect, or store 
                human genomic information and which the Director of 
                National Intelligence or the head of another Federal 
                department or agency reasonably anticipates may use 
                such information in a manner inconsistent with the 
                national security interests of the United States;
                    (B) whether the Department or recipient of such 
                funds from the Department sought to provide funding to, 
                or to use, domestic entities with no such ties to the 
                country or countries of concern for such purposes and 
                any barriers to the use of domestic entities; and
                    (C) whether data use agreements, data security 
                measures, and other such measures taken by the 
                Department or recipient of such funds from the 
                Department are sufficient to protect the identifiable, 
                sensitive information of the people of the United 
                States and the national security interests of the 
                United States; and
            (2) make recommendations to address any vulnerabilities to 
        the United States national security identified, as appropriate.
    (c) Estimation.--In conducting the study under this section, the 
Comptroller General may, as appropriate and necessary to complete such 
study, investigate specific instances of such utilization of genetic 
sequencing services or genetic services, as described in subsection 
(a), to produce estimates of the potential prevalence of such 
utilization among entities in receipt of Departmental funds.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of 
this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit a report on the study 
under this section, in a manner that does not compromise national 
security, to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions 
and the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate, and the

SEC. 6301. ENHANCING ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR THE 21ST CENTURY.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Appropriate committees of congress.--The term 
        ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--
                    (A) the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
                Transportation of the Senate; and
                    (B) the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the 
                House of Representatives.
            (2) Entrepreneur.--The term ``entrepreneur'' means an 
        individual who founded, or is a member of a group that founded, 
        a United States business.
            (3) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary 
        of Commerce.
            (4) United states business.--The term ``United States 
        business'' means a corporation, partnership, association, 
        joint-stock company, business trust, unincorporated 
        organization, or sole proprietorship that--
                    (A) has its principal place of business in the 
                United States; or
                    (B) is organized under the laws of a State of the 
                United States or a territory, possession, or 
                commonwealth of the United States.
    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Recent research has demonstrated that--
                    (A) new businesses (commonly referred to as 
                ``startups'')--
                            (i) are disproportionately responsible for 
                        the innovations that drive economic growth; and
                            (ii) account for virtually all net new job 
                        creation;
                    (B) the rate of formation of United States 
                businesses has fallen significantly in recent years; 
                and
                    (C) as determined by widely cited research, the 
                decline in the rate described in subparagraph (B) is 
                occurring in all 50 States, in all but a handful of 360 
                metro areas examined, and across a broad range of 
                industry sectors.
            (2) Before policymakers can identify ways in which the 
        decline in the rate described in paragraph (1)(B) may be 
        counteracted, the underlying causes of the decline must be 
        identified.
            (3) Economists have identified several factors that may 
        explain the decline in the rate described in paragraph (1)(B), 
        including--
                    (A) demographic changes caused by an aging 
                workforce and slowing population growth;
                    (B) increased industry concentration that may make 
                it more difficult for new market entrants to compete 
                with established companies;
                    (C) increased risk-aversion following the financial 
                crisis and recession that occurred in 2008 and 2009 and 
                deterioration of household balance sheets;
                    (D) difficulties relating to access to capital, 
                particularly difficulties encountered by underserved 
                populations, women, and members of minority groups;
                    (E) the concentration of venture capital in only a 
                few cities;
                    (F) record levels of student debt; and
                    (G) inefficiencies or other difficulties relating 
                to the commercialization of federally funded research 
                and innovation.
    (c) Assessment and Analysis.--
            (1) Assessment and analysis required.--Not later than 2 
        years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary, 
        in consultation with the Director of the Bureau of the Census 
        and the Director of the Bureau of Economic Analysis of the 
        Department of Commerce, shall conduct an assessment and 
        analysis regarding the reasons for the state of the formation 
        of new United States businesses during a period--
                    (A) that the Secretary determines appropriate based 
                on the data described in paragraph (2)(A)(i); and
                    (B) ending on the date on which the assessment and 
                analysis is conducted.
            (2) Considerations and consultation.--
                    (A) In general.--In conducting the assessment and 
                analysis required under paragraph (1), the Secretary 
                shall--
                            (i) notwithstanding any other provision of 
                        Federal law, and subject to subparagraph (B), 
                        review data collected and maintained by--
                                    (I) the Bureau of the Census;
                                    (II) the Bureau of Economic 
                                Analysis;
                                    (III) the Bureau of Labor 
                                Statistics;
                                    (IV) the Small Business 
                                Administration;
                                    (V) the Department of the Treasury;
                                    (VI) the Board of Governors of the 
                                Federal Reserve System; and
                                    (VII) any other Federal or State 
                                agency, or public or private sector 
                                organization, that the Secretary 
                                determines appropriate;
                            (ii) with respect to the formation of new 
                        United States businesses, consider the impact 
                        of--
                                    (I) demographic changes caused by 
                                an aging workforce and slowing 
                                population growth;
                                    (II) increased industry 
                                concentration and whether such 
                                concentration may make it more 
                                difficult for new market entrants to 
                                compete with established companies;
                                    (III) increased risk-aversion 
                                following the financial crisis and 
                                recession that occurred in 2008 and 
                                2009 and deterioration of household 
                                balance sheets;
                                    (IV) difficulties relating to 
                                access to capital, particularly 
                                difficulties encountered by underserved 
                                populations, women, and members of 
                                minority groups;
                                    (V) the concentration of venture 
                                capital in only a few cities;
                                    (VI) record levels of student debt;
                                    (VII) inefficiencies or other 
                                difficulties relating to the 
                                commercialization of federally funded 
                                research and innovation;
                                    (VIII) the use of federally funded 
                                research and innovation in the 
                                commercial market;
                                    (IX) regulatory burden, overlap, 
                                complexity, and uncertainty at the 
                                Federal and State levels;
                                    (X) aspects of the Internal Revenue 
                                Code of 1986 that penalize, obstruct, 
                                or otherwise disadvantage new 
                                businesses, or investors in new 
                                businesses, relative to incumbent 
                                businesses, or investors in incumbent

SEC. 6302. PROHIBITION ON FEDERAL FUNDING FOR WUHAN INSTITUTE OF 
              VIROLOGY.

    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal funding may 
be made available to the Wuhan Institute of Virology located in the 
City of Wuhan in the People's Republic of China.

SEC. 6303. ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROVISIONS OF ECONOMIC 
              AND TRADE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED 
              STATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Agreement includes significant mandates for the 
        People's Republic of China related to its domestic intellectual 
        property regime, including with respect to copyrights, 
        trademarks, trade secrets, and patents;
            (2) the changes included in the Agreement, if implemented 
        effectively, should improve the domestic intellectual property 
        framework of the People's Republic of China, which has 
        historically proven to harm the innovation and creative 
        communities in the United States;
            (3) despite commitments made by the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China under the Agreement, ongoing market 
        access barriers, uneven enforcement, measures requiring forced 
        technology transfer, and serious deficiencies in the rule of 
        law continue to make the business environment in the People's 
        Republic of China highly challenging for rights holders in the 
        United States;
            (4) as reflected in the 2021 report by the United States 
        Trade Representative required under section 182(h) of the Trade 
        Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2242(h)) (commonly referred to as the 
        ``Special 301 Report''), the People's Republic of China has 
        consistently been listed in that annual report since 1989 as a 
        trading partner of the United States that ``fails to provide 
        adequate and effective IP protection and enforcement for U.S. 
        inventors, creators, brands, manufacturers, and service 
        providers, which, in turn, harm American workers''; and
            (5) Congress encourages the United States Trade 
        Representative, the Attorney General, the Secretary of State, 
        the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of Commerce, 
        and the Director of the United States Patent and Trademark 
        Office--
                    (A) to use all available tools to ensure that the 
                People's Republic of China fully implements its 
                commitments under the Agreement; and
                    (B) to actively consider additional means to 
                require the People's Republic of China to address 
                unfair market access barriers, forced technology 
                transfer requirements, and broader intellectual 
                property theft concerns, including through future trade 
                agreements and working with partners in multilateral 
                organizations, such as the Group of 7 (G7), the Group 
                of 20 (G20), and the World Trade Organization.
    (b) Enforcement of Agreement.--The President, acting through the 
United States Trade Representative, shall coordinate with the heads of 
such Federal agencies as the President considers appropriate to enforce 
the actions related to intellectual property laid out in the Agreement 
including--
            (1) the civil, administrative, and criminal procedures and 
        deterrent-level civil and criminal penalties provided in the 
        Agreement; and
            (2) by using the full enforcement authority of the 
        President, including any enforcement authority in connection 
        with the identification and reporting process under section 182 
        of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2242).
    (c) Report on Status of Implementation of Certain Obligations.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, the 
        United States Trade Representative shall submit to the 
        appropriate committees of Congress a report on the status of 
        the implementation by the People's Republic of China of its 
        obligations under Chapter 1 of the Agreement.
            (2) Information in report.--Each report required by 
        paragraph (1) shall contain information sufficient to enable 
        the appropriate committees of Congress to assess the extent of 
        the compliance by the People's Republic of China with the 
        Agreement, including appropriate quantitative metrics.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Agreement.--The term ``Agreement'' means the Economic 
        and Trade Agreement Between the Government of the United States

SEC. 6304. FINDINGS AND SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING AN INVESTIGATION 
              TO DETERMINE THE ORIGINS OF COVID-19.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) COVID-19 has taken the lives of nearly 3,500,000 
        individuals around the world.
            (2) Understanding the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic is 
        essential to addressing our vulnerabilities and preventing 
        future crises.
            (3) In May 2020, the World Health Assembly did not 
        authorize a comprehensive investigation into the origins of 
        COVID-19, and instead passed a significantly limited compromise 
        resolution, with Chinese government support, which did not 
        explicitly include in its scope the possibility of a research-
        related accident.
            (4) The 2020 World Health Assembly resolution and its terms 
        of reference, which were negotiated privately between the World 
        Health Organization (in this section referred to as ``WHO'') 
        and Chinese authorities, handed the Chinese government control 
        over the joint-study process by giving the Chinese government 
        veto power over which international experts were allowed to 
        participate in the joint study and by agreeing that most 
        primary research would be carried out by Chinese teams without 
        ensuring broad access to primary data by international experts.
            (5) As a result of these terms, the significant structural, 
        procedural, and analytical shortcomings of the joint study, and 
        the severe restrictions imposed by Chinese authorities, the 
        WHO-convened joint study into the origins of COVID-19 was 
        prevented from providing a balanced consideration of the 
        multiple theories of the origin of COVID-19.
            (6) Only 4 of the 313 pages of the joint-study team report 
        and its annexes addressed the possibility of a laboratory 
        accident, and no thorough examination of the lab incident 
        hypothesis was carried out by the joint-study team.
            (7) Some of the international experts on the joint-study 
        team stated that they lacked the means and resources to 
        properly investigate the research-related accident hypothesis, 
        and they were neither able nor meant to do such a full 
        investigation but instead were acting as a ``study review 
        group''.
            (8) WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus 
        commented on March 30, 2021, the day the joint-study report was 
        released, ``I do not believe that [the joint-study team's] 
        assessment [of a possible lab incident] was extensive enough. 
        Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust 
        conclusions . . . potentially with additional missions 
        involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy.''.
            (9) The WHO Director-General further commented, ``As far as 
        WHO is concerned all hypotheses remain on the table . . . We 
        have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must 
        continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned as 
        we do . . . It is clear that we need more research across a 
        range of areas, which will entail further field visits.''.
            (10) The March 30, 2021 Joint Statement on the WHO-convened 
        COVID-19 Origins Study by the United States and 13 other 
        countries recognized the severe shortcomings of the joint-study 
        process and called for ``a transparent and independent analysis 
        and evaluation, free from interference and undue influence.''.
            (11) In spite of the devastation the COVID-19 pandemic has 
        caused in the United States and around the world, no process 
        currently exists to ensure a comprehensive investigation into 
        the source of COVID-19.
            (12) Such an investigation is essential for ensuring this 
        type of crisis never happens again for the benefit of all 
        people, all nations, and future generations.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) a comprehensive investigation to determine the origins 
        of COVID-19 must be conducted by WHO immediately, with access 
        to all relevant records, samples, and personnel in China, and 
        that such investigation must fully explore all possible sources 
        of the COVID-19 pandemic, including exclusively ``natural'' 
        zoonosis in the wild, human contamination in an animal farm, 
        and a research-related accident;
            (2) the United States delegation to the World Health 
        Assembly should, in concert with allies and partners around the 
        world, work to ensure that an international scientific 
        investigation into the origins of COVID-19, with full access to 
        all relevant records, samples, and personnel in China, will be 
        authorized by the World Health Assembly and implemented with 
        extreme urgency; and
            (3) should such a full investigation not be authorized by 
        the 2021 World Health Assembly, then the United States 
        Government should immediately begin planning a comprehensive 
        and data-driven investigation into the COVID-19 pandemic 
        origins, in concert with willing partner governments and 
        experts around the world.

    (a) Findings; Sense of Congress.--
            (1) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
                    (A) The People's Republic of China is the global 
                leader in mining, refining, and component manufacturing 
                of rare earth elements, producing approximately 85 
                percent of the world's supply between 2011 and 2017.
                    (B) In 2019, the United States imported an 
                estimated 80 percent of its rare earth compounds from 
                the People's Republic of China.
                    (C) On March 26, 2014, the World Trade Organization 
                ruled that the People's Republic of China's export 
                restraints on rare earth minerals violated its 
                obligations under its protocol of accession to the 
                World Trade Organization, thereby harming United States 
                manufacturers and workers.
                    (D) The Chinese Communist Party has threatened to 
                leverage the People's Republic of China's dominant 
                position in the rare earth market to ``strike back'' at 
                the United States.
                    (E) The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue is an 
                effective partnership for reliable multilateral 
                financing, development, and distribution of goods for 
                global consumption, as evidenced by the Quad Vaccine 
                Partnership announced on March 12, 2021.
            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
                    (A) the People's Republic of China's dominant share 
                of the global rare earth mining market is a threat to 
                the economic stability, well being, and competitiveness 
                of key industries in the United States;
                    (B) the United States should reduce reliance on the 
                People's Republic of China for rare earth minerals 
                through--
                            (i) strategic investments in development 
                        projects, production technologies, and refining 
                        facilities in the United States; or
                            (ii) in partnership with strategic allies 
                        of the United States that are reliable trading 
                        partners, including members of the 
                        Quadrilateral Security Dialogue; and
                    (C) the United States Trade Representative should 
                initiate multilateral talks among the countries of the 
                Quadrilateral Security Dialogue to promote shared 
                investment and development of rare earth minerals.
    (b) Report Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the United States Trade 
        Representative, in consultation with the officials specified in

                report; and
                    (B) a description of the plans of the President to 
                leverage the partnership of the countries of the 
                Quadrilateral Security Dialogue to produce a more 
                reliable and secure global supply chain of rare earth

                                perceived or realized challenges in 
                                securing the input;

                                national security or the effect on the 
                                United States business; or
                                    (V) in the case of an input sourced 
                                from a foreign country, information

                                        produced in the United States;

TITLE III--IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY AND ADMINISTRATION OF TRADE PROGRAMS 
           AND OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF TRADE AGENCIES

SEC. 73001. PROCESS FOR EXCLUSION OF ARTICLES FROM DUTIES UNDER SECTION 
              301 OF THE TRADE ACT OF 1974.

    (a) Establishment of General Exclusion Process.--
            (1) In general.--Title III of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 
        U.S.C. 2411 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section 305 
        the following:

``SEC. 305A. PROCESS FOR EXCLUSION OF ARTICLES FROM DUTIES.

    ``(a) Analysis of Alternative Action.--Subject to subsection (d), 
before taking action under section 301(b), the Trade Representative 
shall analyze the impact of the action on United States entities, 
particularly small entities, and consumers in the United States with a 
goal of mitigating the impact of duties on United States entities and 
consumers in the United States, including by evaluating alternatives or 
modifications to particular actions.
    ``(b) Process for Exclusion From Duties.--
            ``(1) In general.--Subject to subsection (d), the Trade 
        Representative shall establish and maintain a process for 
        exclusion requests from duties under section 301(b) unless the 
        Trade Representative determines and certifies to the 
        appropriate congressional committees that maintaining an 
        exclusion process--
                    ``(A) would impair the ability of the United States 
                to maintain effective pressure to remove unreasonable 
                or discriminatory practices burdening commerce in the 
                United States; or
                    ``(B) is impractical due to the low value of the 
                duties imposed.
            ``(2) Briefing.--If the Trade Representative makes a 
        certification under paragraph (1), not later than 3 days before 
        making the certification, the Trade Representative shall brief 
        the appropriate congressional committees regarding the reasons 
        for the certification.
            ``(3) Continued certification.--If the Trade Representative 
        makes a certification under paragraph (1) with respect to 
        duties under section 301(b), not less frequently than once 
        every 180 days while those duties are in effect, the Trade 
        Representative shall determine and certify to the appropriate 
        congressional committees that the reasons for forgoing an 
        exclusion process with respect to those duties continue to be 
        present.
    ``(c) Implementation of Exclusion Process.--
            ``(1) In general.--In implementing an exclusion process 
        required under subsection (b)(1), the Trade Representative 
        shall consider whether and which criteria described in 
        paragraph (2), and such other criteria as the Trade 
        Representative considers appropriate under the circumstances, 
        are appropriate to apply in the exclusion process.
            ``(2) Criteria described.--The criteria described in this 
        paragraph for exclusion of articles from duties under section 
        301(b) include the following:
                    ``(A) Whether the failure to grant the exclusion 
                would result in severe economic harm to the requester.
                    ``(B) Whether the article or a reasonable 
                substitute is not commercially available to the 
                requester.
                    ``(C) Whether the imposition of the duty with 
                respect to the article would unreasonably increase 
                consumer prices for day-to-day items consumed by low- 
                or middle-income families in the United States.
                    ``(D) Whether the imposition of the duty would have 
                an unreasonable impact on manufacturing output of the 
                United States.
                    ``(E) Whether the imposition of the duty would have 
                an unreasonable impact on the ability of an entity to 
                fulfill contracts or to build critical infrastructure.
                    ``(F) Whether the failure to grant the exclusion is 
                likely to result in a particular entity or entities 
                having the ability to abuse a dominant market position.
    ``(d) Exclusion of Certain Duties.--This section shall not apply to 
duties imposed under section 301(b) pursuant to a dispute resolution 
process under the World Trade Organization.
    ``(e) Publication of Notice.--Subject to subsection (d), not later 
than 90 days after imposing any duty under section 301(b), the Trade 
Representative, in consultation with such other Federal agencies as the 
Trade Representative considers appropriate, shall publish a notice in 
the Federal Register regarding the criteria that the Trade 
Representative will apply and the evidence it will evaluate in 
determining whether a request for exclusion from such duty satisfies 
the requirements of the exclusion process under subsection (b)(1).
    ``(f) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term 
        `appropriate congressional committees' means--
                    ``(A) the Committee on Finance of the Senate; and
                    ``(B) the Committee on Ways and Means of the House 
                of Representatives.

        harm', with respect to an exclusion from duties requested by a

            (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of contents for the 
        Trade Act of 1974 is amended by inserting after the item 
        relating to section 305 the following:

``Sec. 305A. Process for exclusion of articles from duties.''.
    (b) Establishment of Exclusion Process for Certain Duties Relating 
to People's Republic of China.--
            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of 
        law, the United States Trade Representative shall establish a 
        process pursuant to which United States entities and 
        associations of those entities may request the exclusion of 
        articles from duties described in paragraph (2).
            (2) Duties described.--The duties described in this 
        paragraph are duties imposed pursuant to the investigation 
        initiated under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 
        2411) on August 18, 2017, and with respect to which notice was 
        published in the Federal Register on August 24, 2017 (82 Fed. 
        Reg. 40213).
            (3) Implementation of exclusion process.--In implementing 
        the process established under paragraph (1) for exclusion of 
        articles from duties described in paragraph (2), if the 
        exclusion of the article can likely be administered by U.S. 
        Customs and Border Protection--
                    (A) the Trade Representative shall exclude that 
                article from the imposition of such a duty if the Trade 
                Representative determines, following a request from a 
                United States entity or an association of those 
                entities, that the failure to grant the exclusion would 
                result in severe economic harm to the requester;
                    (B) unless the Trade Representative determines that 
                granting the exclusion would impair the ability of the 
                United States to maintain effective pressure to remove 
                an unreasonable or discriminatory practice burdening 
                United States commerce, the Trade Representative shall 
                exclude that article from the imposition of such a duty 
                if the Trade Representative determines following a 
                request from a United States entity or an association 
                of those entities that--
                            (i) the article or a reasonable substitute 
                        is not commercially available to the requester;
                            (ii) the imposition of the duty with 
                        respect to the article would unreasonably 
                        increase consumer prices for day-to-day items 
                        consumed by low- or middle-income families in 
                        the United States;
                            (iii) the imposition of the duty would have 
                        an unreasonable impact on manufacturing output 
                        of the United States;
                            (iv) the imposition of the duty would have 
                        an unreasonable impact on the ability of an 
                        entity to fulfill contracts or to build 
                        critical infrastructure; or
                            (v) the failure to grant the exclusion is 
                        likely to result in a particular entity or 
                        entities having the ability to abuse a dominant 
                        market position; and
                    (C) the Trade Representative may identify other 
                criteria relevant to determining whether the article 
                shall be excluded from the imposition of such a duty.
            (4) Timeframe of exclusion and renewal.--
                    (A) Period of exclusion.--An exclusion of an 
                article requested under paragraph (1) from duties 
                described in paragraph (2)--
                            (i) shall be for a period of 18 months; and
                            (ii) shall be decided--
                                    (I) not later than 90 days before 
                                the duty is due to be paid; or
                                    (II) if the Trade Representative 
                                determines that the request presents 
                                exceptionally complex issues or 
                                requires additional evidence, not later 
                                than 120 days before the duty is due to 
                                be paid.
                    (B) Renewal.--The Trade Representative shall allow 
                applications for renewal of an exclusion under 
                paragraph (1) to be submitted not later than 90 days 
                before the exclusion is set to expire.
                    (C) Failure to act.--If the Trade Representative 
                fails to decide an exclusion request under subparagraph 
                (A)(ii) during the appropriate period set forth under 
                that subparagraph, the exclusion request will be deemed 
                to have been granted until the date that is 30 days 
                after the Trade Representative publishes in the Federal 
                Register a decision not to grant the request.
            (5) Written reasoning.--
                    (A) In general.--If the Trade Representative denies 
                a request for an exclusion under paragraph (1), the 
                Trade Representative shall provide to the requester of 
                the exclusion a reasoned determination for denying the 
                request.
                    (B) Substantial evidence.--A determination under 
                subparagraph (A) shall be supported by substantial 
                evidence from the administrative record.
            (6) Review.--
                    (A) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the 
                date of the enactment of this Act, and annually 
                thereafter, the Comptroller General of the United 
                States shall conduct an audit of the exclusion process 
                established under paragraph (1).
                    (B) Elements of audit.--Each audit required by 
                subparagraph (A) shall--
                            (i) include a review of the process for--
                                    (I) receiving and reviewing 
                                exclusion requests under paragraph (1);
                                    (II) determining eligibility for an 
                                exclusion;
                                    (III) applying relevant criteria 
                                for an exclusion; and

                        the Court of International Trade or the Chapter 
                        10 Panel found that the Secretary failed to 
                        observe or the specific provision of the WTO 
                        Agreement that a dispute settlement panel or 
                        Appellate Body found to have been breached by 
                        the determination; and
                            (ii) whether or when the Secretary intends 
                        to comply with the order or obligations 
                        described in subparagraph (A), as the case may

        Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1862) during the year covered 
        by the report, including--
                    (A) the approximate number of hours and employees 
                of the Department of Commerce (full-time equivalent) 
                working on that process;
                    (B) the number of requests for exclusion that have 
                been pending for more than 120 days; and
                    (C) a list of all exclusions that have been 
                decided, including by identifying whether the specific 
                request for an exclusion was granted or not, and the 
                time it took to decide the request.

SEC. 73006. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON LEADERSHIP AT WORLD TRADE 
              ORGANIZATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States had led the formation, as well as 
        reform, of rules governing the multilateral trading system 
        since World War II.
            (2) The United States is a founding member of the World 
        Trade Organization (in this section referred to as the ``WTO'') 
        and a key architect of the organization.
            (3) The United States secured important commitments in the 
        WTO to facilitate trade in goods and services, to prevent the 
        application of non-scientific restrictions on United States 
        agriculture, and to protect United States intellectual 
        property.
            (4) The United States uses the rules of the WTO to benefit 
        workers, farmers, fishers, and businesses in the United States 
        by facilitating access to the 90 percent of the world's 
        consumers who live outside the borders of the United States.
            (5) The fundamental purpose of the WTO is to create space 
        for members to negotiate with each other, and the WTO reserves 
        to those members exclusively the right to negotiate and adopt 
        rules that reduce and eliminate trade barriers and 
        discriminatory treatment.
            (6) The prompt settlement of disputes in which a member of 
        the WTO considers that its rights are being impaired by the 
        actions of another member is essential to the functioning of 
        the WTO and the maintenance of a proper balance between the 
        rights and obligations of members.
            (7) The WTO's dispute settlement function, including in 
        particular the Appellate Body, has increasingly failed to 
        enforce the rules of the WTO in a timely manner, and has 
        usurped the negotiating prerogative of members by creating new 
        obligations and rights that are inconsistent with or not 
        included in the rules negotiated by members.
            (8) The creation of those obligations and rights 
        undermines--
                    (A) the WTO's negotiating function by discouraging 
                members from making concessions; and
                    (B) the WTO's dispute settlement function by 
                encouraging overuse of the process and undermining its 
                legitimacy, including by preventing free market 
                economies from responding to globally trade distortive 
                practices by nonmarket economies.
            (9) The WTO does not have sufficient rules to discipline 
        the distortive economic policies of nonmarket economies, such 
        as policies relating to excess capacity and forced technology 
        transfer, the special treatment those economies afford to 
        state-owned enterprises, and their massive and opaque 
        industrial subsidies.
            (10) There is long-standing bipartisan support in Congress 
        to reform the WTO to address those failings.
            (11) The current presidential administration, as well as 
        prior administrations, raised concerns about the failings 
        described in this subsection and have made reform of the WTO a 
        top priority of United States trade policy.
            (12) The United States urges WTO members to work 
        constructively with the United States to assess the reasons why 
        the existing WTO rules have proven inadequate in order to 
        create an atmosphere within the WTO that is conducive to the 
        development of new rules less subject to jurisprudential drift.
            (13) The guiding principle for reform of the WTO, and the 
        lens through which WTO members should consider specific reform 
        proposals, is the restoration of the WTO's capability and 
        capacity for negotiation among members.
            (14) The United States has achieved its trade policy 
        objectives through active leadership at the WTO, and an absence 
        of that leadership would be filled by nonmarket economies that 
        are hostile to a host of United States interests.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) while the United States finds value and usefulness in 
        the WTO, in order to fulfill the needs of the United States and 
        other free and open economies in the 21st century, significant 
        reforms are needed;
            (2) the United States must therefore continue to 
        demonstrate leadership to achieve reforms that restore the 
        effectiveness of the WTO's--
                    (A) negotiating function;
                    (B) dispute settlement function so that it 
                transparently, efficiently, and fully enforces outcomes 
                negotiated by members rather than usurping their 
                primacy by creating new rights or obligations; and
                    (C) rules for special and differential treatment to 
                ensure those rules promote advancement for truly 
                developing countries, rather than becoming tools for 
                globally competitive countries, like the People's 
                Republic of China, to engage in protectionism and 
                market distortions;
            (3) the efforts to reform the negotiating function of the 
        WTO should revitalize the negotiating function by providing 
        confidence to members that the WTO operates according to the 
        rules as negotiated and adopted by members;
            (4) a revitalized negotiating function must include new 
        rules that reflect the 21st century economy, further combat 
        anticompetitive and protectionist barriers, and ensure disputes 
        are efficiently resolved;
            (5) the United States Trade Representative should continue 
        to lead efforts to work with WTO members to pursue reforms at 
        the WTO that--
                    (A) ensure the dispute settlement mechanism 
                faithfully applies the rules adopted by members, 
                including by undertaking measures to ensure the WTO's 
                Appellate Body does not create new rights and 
                obligations;
                    (B) improve public confidence in dispute settlement 
                by promoting greater transparency and efficiency in the 
                conduct of proceedings;
                    (C) redress the consistent failure by certain 
                members to satisfy their notification obligations under 
                various WTO agreements, including through measures that 
                strengthen accountability;
                    (D) ensure rules for special and differential 
                treatment are appropriately reserved for countries 
                whose state of development and global competitiveness 
                actually warrants such flexibility;
                    (E) create new rules and structures that can serve 
                the interests of the United States while promoting 
                peace, prosperity, good governance, transparency, 
                effective operation of legal regimes, the rule of law, 
                and free enterprise; and
                    (F) expand upon the trilateral negotiations 
                currently underway with Japan and the European Union; 
                and
            (6) the United States Trade Representative should explore 
        and assess specific reform proposals, including--
                    (A) pursuing plurilateral agreements that further 
                the interests of the United States while limiting the 
                benefits accruing to countries that are not parties to 
                those agreements;
                    (B) efforts to ensure that incorrect 
                interpretations by the Appellate Body, including with 
                respect to the Agreement on Safeguards, the Agreement 
                on Implementation of Article VI of the General 
                Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994, and the Agreement 
                on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures, are 
                corrected, and not to be deemed precedential;
                    (C) new rules and norms to address practices of 
                nonmarket economies, such as practices relating to 
                state-owned enterprises, which certain countries often 
                utilize for objectives that cause severe trade 
                distortions; and
                    (D) better implementation of existing rules, such 
                as the prohibition in paragraph 4 of Article XIV of the 
                General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on currency 
                manipulation, to ensure that those rules are effective 
                to preserve the rights of free market economies.
