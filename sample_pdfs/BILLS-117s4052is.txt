    (a) In General.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study reviewing State early hearing detection and 
intervention (in this section referred to as ``EHDI'') programs. Such 
study shall--
            (1) analyze how information collected through such programs 
        informs what is known about EHDI activities to ensure that 
        newborns, infants, and young children have access to timely 
        hearing screenings and early interventions, including 
        information on any disparities in such access;
            (2) analyze what is known about how parents use State EHDI 
        websites to seek health and programmatic guidance related to 
        their child's hearing loss diagnosis; and
            (3) identify efforts and any promising practices of the 
        Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Health 
        Resources and Services Administration, the National Institute 
        on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, and State EHDI 
        programs--
                    (A) to address disparities in outreach for, or 
                access to, timely hearing screenings and early 
                interventions; and
                    (B) to ensure that EHDI follow-up services are 
                communicated and made available to medically 
                underserved populations, including racial and ethnic 
                minorities.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Comptroller General shall--
            (1) complete the study under subsection (a) and submit a 
        report on the results of the study to--
                    (A) the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the 
                House of Representatives; and
                    (B) the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and 
                Pensions of the Senate; and
            (2) make such report publicly available.
