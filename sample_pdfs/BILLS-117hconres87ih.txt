 Honoring the life and legacy of Ulysses S. Grant in commemoration of 
                          his 200th Birthday.

Whereas, on July 1, 1843, Ulysses S. Grant graduated from the United States 
        Military Academy at West Point, and, on July 31, 1854, Grant resigned 
        from the Army at the grade of Captain;
Whereas, following President Abraham Lincoln's April 15, 1861, proclamation 
        calling for 75,000 volunteers to suppress Confederate forces, Ulysses S. 
        Grant rejoined the Army and helped recruit and train volunteer soldiers 
        for the Union;
Whereas, over the course of the American Civil War, Ulysses S. Grant commanded a 
        cumulative total of over 620,000 Union soldiers and achieved major 
        victories, including Fort Henry (February 1862), Fort Donelson (February 
        1862), Shiloh (April 1862), the Vicksburg Campaign (November 1862-July 
        1863), Chattanooga (November 1863), the Wilderness Campaign (May 1864-
        June 1864), the Petersburg Campaign (June 1864-April 1865), and the 
        Appomattox Campaign (April 1865);
Whereas, on February 29, 1864, Congress reestablished the grade of ``Lieutenant-
        General of the United States Army'' and authorized the President to 
        appoint, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, an officer 
        who was ``most distinguished for courage, skill, and ability'' (38th 
        Congress, Session I, Chap. 14, Sec. 1), and that same day, President 
        Abraham Lincoln nominated Ulysses S. Grant to be Lieutenant-General;
Whereas, on March 10, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln formally appointed Ulysses 
        S. Grant to the grade of Lieutenant-General of the Army, a position 
        previously held by only George Washington and Winfield Scott, although 
        Scott's promotion was a brevet appointment;
Whereas, on July 25, 1866, Congress established the grade of ``General of the 
        Army of the United States'' (39th Congress, Session I, Chap. 232), and 
        Ulysses S. Grant was appointed, by and with the advice and consent of 
        the Senate, to General of the Army of the United States for his role in 
        commanding the Union armies during the Civil War;
Whereas, on March 4, 1869, Ulysses S. Grant was sworn in as the 18th President 
        of the United States; and
Whereas, throughout his two terms as President, Ulysses S. Grant secured the 
        ratification of the 15th Amendment to the Constitution, the creation of 
        the Department of Justice, and the passage and implementation of the 
        Civil Rights Act of 1875: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) honors Ulysses S. Grant for his efforts and leadership 
        in defending the union of the United States of America;
            (2) recognizes that the military victories achieved under 
        the command of Ulysses S. Grant were integral to the 
        preservation of the United States of America; and
            (3) affirms that Ulysses S. Grant is among the most 
        influential military commanders in the history of the United 
        States of America.
