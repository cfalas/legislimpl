                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for the designation of the week of May 2, 2022, 
 through May 5, 2022, as ``National Small Business Week'' to celebrate 
   the contributions of small businesses and entrepreneurs in every 
                    community in the United States.

Whereas a ``National Small Business Week'' has been declared by every President 
        since 1963;
Whereas there are around 32,000,000 small businesses in the United States that 
        support nearly 61,000,000 jobs;
Whereas every congressional district in the United States contains a small 
        business;
Whereas thousands of small business establishments still face significant 
        challenges recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic;
Whereas small businesses have played an integral role in rebuilding the economy 
        of the Nation;
Whereas Congress established the Small Business Administration in 1953 to aid, 
        counsel, assist, and protect interests of small business to ensure that 
        a fair proportion of total purchases, contracts, and subcontracts for 
        property and services for the Federal Government are placed with small 
        businesses, to make certain access to critical capital is made available 
        to such small businesses, and to maintain and strengthen the overall 
        economy;
Whereas the Small Business Administration has helped small businesses with 
        access to critical lending opportunities, played a key role in ensuring 
        full and open competition for government contracts, and improved the 
        economic environment in which small businesses compete; and
Whereas May 2, 2022, through May 5, 2022, would be an appropriate week to 
        celebrate ``National Small Business Week'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) honors and celebrates the entrepreneurial spirit and 
        contributions of small businesses in every community in the 
        United States;
            (2) applauds the efforts and achievements the owners of 
        small businesses and their employees have played during the 
        pandemic in every community of the United States;
            (3) recognizes that in the face of significant challenges, 
        the owners of small businesses have demonstrated incredible 
        resilience for more than 2 years;
            (4) understands that the Small Business Administration can 
        help small business recover and build back from the global 
        pandemic;
            (5) supports the designation of ``National Small Business 
        Week''; and
            (6) supports efforts to--
                    (A) encourage consumers to utilize small 
                businesses;
                    (B) increase awareness of the value of small 
                businesses and the impact they have on rebuilding the 
                economy of the United States;
                    (C) hold Federal agencies accountable for meeting 
                procurement goals for small businesses, including the 
                goals for small businesses owned and controlled by 
                service-disabled veterans, small businesses owned and 
                controlled by women, HUBZone small businesses, and 
                socially and economically disadvantaged small 
                businesses;
                    (D) ensure guaranteed loans and microloans for 
                startup and growing small businesses are made available 
                to all qualified small businesses;
                    (E) provide small businesses the technical 
                assistance and counseling that they desperately need;
                    (F) facilitate access to affordable broadband 
                service to foster rural small business growth; and
                    (G) foster systems of intellectual property 
                protection for small business innovation.
