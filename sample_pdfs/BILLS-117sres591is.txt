                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing support for the designation of April 10, 2022, as ``Venture 
                          Smith Freedom Day''.

Whereas, in about 1729, Venture Smith was born free in West Africa and, in 1739, 
        was seized from his home and enslaved in New England;
Whereas 257 years ago, in the year 1765, Venture Smith, at the age of 36, 
        purchased his freedom;
Whereas Venture Smith went on to free his family from the bondage of slavery;
Whereas Venture Smith became a successful landowner, businessman, and author in 
        the United States, generations before Black Americans began to obtain 
        constitutional, legal, social, and economic rights;
Whereas, in November 1798, Venture Smith was the first African American to write 
        and publish his own autobiography;
Whereas Venture Smith was the first person to write and publish the phrase, ``My 
        freedom is a privilege which nothing else can equal'';
Whereas Venture Smith died a free man on September 19, 1805, in Connecticut; and
Whereas April 10 would be an appropriate date to designate as ``Venture Smith 
        Freedom Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate supports the designation of ``Venture 
Smith Freedom Day'' on April 10, which would recognize the 257th 
anniversary of Venture Smith purchasing his freedom and going on to 
become a landowner, businessman, and author in Connecticut.
