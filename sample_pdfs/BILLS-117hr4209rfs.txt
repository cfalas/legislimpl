                identify, breach, assess, and remediate illicit cross-
                border tunnels in a manner that, among other 
                considerations, reduces the impact of such activities 
                on surrounding communities.
                    (C) Processes to share relevant illicit cross-
                border tunnel location, operations, and technical 
                information.

                border tunnels found in each U.S. Border Patrol sector 
                identified through operations to be periodically 
                disseminated to U.S. Border Patrol sector chiefs to 
                educate field personnel.
                    (E) A counter illicit cross-border tunnel 
                operations resource needs assessment that includes

                                operations personnel.
                                    (II) Any specialized skills 
                                required of such personnel.
                                    (III) The number of such full time 
                                personnel, disaggregated by U.S. Border

            (2) Report to congress on strategic plan.--Not later than 
        one year after the development of the strategic plan, the
