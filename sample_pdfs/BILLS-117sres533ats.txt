                               RESOLUTION


 
         Celebrating the centennial of Navy aircraft carriers.

Whereas 100 years ago, on March 20, 1922, following a 2-year conversion at 
        Norfolk Naval Shipyard, the former USS Jupiter (Collier #3) was 
        recommissioned as USS Langley (CV-1), the first aircraft carrier of the 
        Navy;
Whereas USS Langley began as an experimental platform, laying the foundation for 
        the future shipboard operations of aircraft;
Whereas, in fleet exercises beginning in 1924, the USS Langley, appropriately 
        nicknamed the ``Covered Wagon'', demonstrated the potential of the 
        aircraft carrier as an invaluable weapons system that would transform 
        how the Navy fought at sea;
Whereas, for the past 100 years, aircraft carriers have furthered United States 
        interest in times of war and peace;
Whereas, from the great naval battles in the Pacific Ocean during World War II 
        to strike and close air support missions in the battlegrounds of the 
        Korean Peninsula and Vietnam, the execution of joint force operations 
        over the sands of the Middle East, and present-day deterrence in 
        numerous locations around the world, aircraft carriers have proven time 
        and again that they invaluable in supporting the strategic goals of the 
        United States;
Whereas, with an unequaled ability to provide warfighting capabilities across 
        the full spectrum of conflict and to adapt in the face of ever-changing 
        threats, aircraft carriers and their embarked air wings and associated 
        strike groups are the foundation of United States maritime strategy;
Whereas aircraft carriers enable the Armed Forces to carry out operations from 
        international waters, often obviating the need to obtain flyover and 
        land-based rights from other countries;
Whereas Nimitz and Gerald R. Ford-class aircraft carriers are modern, mobile 
        military bases each complete with an airfield, a hospital, and a 
        hardened communications system from which the United States can strike 
        at enemies, wherever and whenever it chooses;
Whereas there are more than 2,450 companies in 48 States and more than 364 
        congressional districts and more than 13,100 individuals, who proudly 
        contribute to the construction and maintenance of these complex and 
        technologically advanced ships; and
Whereas countless members of the Armed Forces have served the United States 
        aboard aircraft carriers in war, peace, and times of crisis: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes that aircraft carriers continue to be a 
        cornerstone of the Navy and play a vital role in the defense of 
        the United States;
            (2) acknowledges that, in a time of great power competition 
        that the world has not seen for over 30 years, aircraft 
        carriers will continue to be an absolutely vital strategic 
        platform that the United States can wield to ensure security 
        and stability throughout the world, now and well into the 
        future;
            (3) in this 100th year since USS Langley (CV-1) was 
        commissioned at Norfolk Naval Shipyard, recognizes the role 
        aircraft carriers have played in securing peace for the United 
        States and the continuing role aircraft carriers will play in 
        maintaining peace and security for the United States; and
            (4) celebrates the centennial of Navy aircraft carriers.
