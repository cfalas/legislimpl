                                 A BILL


 
To require the Secretary of Energy to complete and publish a study and 
 develop a plan related to the ability of the electric system to meet 
the electricity demand of new electric vehicle charging infrastructure, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Electric Vehicle Grid Readiness, 
Improvement, and Development Act'' or the ``EV GRID Act''.

SEC. 2. STUDY AND PLAN RELATED TO ABILITY OF THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM TO 
              MEET THE ELECTRICITY DEMAND OF NEW ELECTRIC VEHICLE 
              CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE.

    (a) Study.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 6 months after the date of 
        enactment of this section, the Secretary of Energy shall 
        complete and publish on the website of the Department of Energy 
        a study that assesses the ability of the electric system to 
        meet the electricity demand of electric vehicle charging 
        infrastructure that is installed on or after the date of 
        enactment of this section.
            (2) Inclusions.--The study completed and published under 
        paragraph (1) shall--
                    (A) include an estimate of--
                            (i) the amount of growth in the use of 
                        electric vehicles that is necessary to meet the 
                        President's greenhouse gas reduction target; 
                        and
                            (ii) how much additional electrical 
                        generation, transmission, and distribution 
                        capacity will need to be added to the electric 
                        system to meet the electricity demand of 
                        electric vehicle charging infrastructure that 
                        is installed on or after the date of enactment 
                        of this section, including how such electricity 
                        demand varies by geography, population density, 
                        vehicle-grid interaction scenario, and the time 
                        of usage of such electric vehicle charging 
                        infrastructure; and
                    (B) identify geographic areas in which greater 
                investment in the electric system is necessary to meet 
                the electricity demand of electric vehicle charging 
                infrastructure installed on or after the date of 
                enactment of this section in such geographic areas.
    (b) Plan and Recommendations.--Not later than 3 months after the 
date on which the study is published under subsection (a), the 
Secretary of Energy shall, in coordination with the Building a Better 
Grid Initiative of the Office of Electricity and the Vehicle 
Technologies Office of the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable 
Energy--
            (1) develop a plan, based on such study, for how the 
        Department of Energy may assist the electric system with 
        meeting the increase in the demand for electricity estimated in 
        such study; and
            (2) provide to Congress recommendations for legislation 
        that would support the Department of Energy with assisting the 
        electric system as described in paragraph (1).
    (c) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized to be 
appropriated to the Secretary of Energy to carry out this section 
$4,000,000 for fiscal year 2023.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Electric vehicle charging infrastructure.--The term 
        ``electric vehicle charging infrastructure'' means the charging 
        infrastructure necessary to support light duty, medium duty, 
        and heavy duty on-road electric vehicles, including such 
        charging infrastructure that is located at a workplace, 
        recreational destination, vehicle corridor, home, or depot.
            (2) President's greenhouse gas reduction target.--The term 
        ``President's greenhouse gas reduction target'' means the 
        President's target of reducing greenhouse gas pollution by 50 
        to 52 percent from 2005 levels by 2030.
