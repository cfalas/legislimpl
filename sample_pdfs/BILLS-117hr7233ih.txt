    (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall 
issue proposed guidance to State Medicaid agencies, elementary and 
secondary schools, and school-based health centers on reducing 
administrative barriers to such schools and centers furnishing 
specified health services and obtaining reimbursement for such services 
under titles XIX and XXI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et 
seq., 1397aa et seq.).
    (b) Contents of Guidance.--The guidance issued pursuant to 
subsection (a) shall--

        and XXI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq., 
        1397aa et seq.) for the provision of specified health services, 
        including such services provided in accordance with an 
        individualized education program or under the ``free care'' 
        policy described in the State Medicaid Director letter on 
        payment for services issued on December 15, 2014 (#14-006);
            (3) take into account reasons why small and rural local 
        education agencies may choose not to provide specified health 
        services, and consider approaches to encourage such agencies to 
        provide such services; and
            (4) include best practices and examples of methods that 
        State Medicaid agencies and local education agencies have used 
        to reimburse for, and increase the availability of, specified 
        health services.

        health plan (or waiver of such plan) under title XXI of such
