                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating March 2022 as ``World Down Syndrome Month'' and supporting 
           the goals and ideals of World Down Syndrome Month.

Whereas 1 in every 691 babies born in the United States has Down syndrome, and 
        only 1 in every 1,100 worldwide;
Whereas Down syndrome is the most frequent chromosomal condition and occurs in 
        all racial, ethnic, and economic groups;
Whereas individuals with Down syndrome attend school, work, make their own life 
        decisions, have meaningful relationships, vote, and contribute to 
        society;
Whereas advancements in education, medical care, research, and advocacy and 
        positive support from family, friends, and the community contribute to 
        individuals with Down syndrome living healthy and fulfilling lives;
Whereas promoting inclusive education, competitive integrated employment, and 
        home and community-based services for individuals with Down syndrome is 
        vital to individuals with Down syndrome achieving independence, economic 
        self-sufficiency, and full participation in society;
Whereas the life expectancy of individuals with Down syndrome in the United 
        States has increased dramatically in recent decades, from 25 years of 
        age in 1983 to 60 years of age in 2022;
Whereas racial and ethnic minorities with Down syndrome experience life 
        expectancy and health care disparities, which should be understood and 
        addressed;
Whereas individuals with Down syndrome have different health profiles than other 
        individuals, as individuals with Down syndrome are predisposed to 
        develop certain major diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, leukemia, 
        and Alzheimer's disease, and may not experience other major diseases, 
        such as solid tumor cancers, certain heart attacks, and stroke;
Whereas individuals with Down syndrome should have access to health care 
        providers who have easy access to updated, evidence-based medical care 
        guidelines for children and adults with Down syndrome;
Whereas parents of babies and children with Down syndrome should receive the 
        education and support they need to understand Down syndrome;
Whereas, on October 8, 2008, the Prenatally and Postnatally Diagnosed Conditions 
        Awareness Act (Public Law 110-374; 122 Stat. 4051) was enacted to 
        increase referrals in the United States to providers of key support 
        services for mothers who have received a positive prenatal diagnosis for 
        Down syndrome or a positive diagnosis for other prenatally or 
        postnatally diagnosed conditions;
Whereas the United States, along with over 100 other countries, officially 
        observes the date March 21 as World Down Syndrome Day, because Down 
        syndrome occurs when an individual is born with 3 copies of chromosome 
        21; and
Whereas the inherent dignity and worth of individuals with Down syndrome, the 
        valuable contributions of individuals with Down syndrome as promoters of 
        well-being and diversity within their communities, and the importance of 
        the individual freedom and independence of individuals with Down 
        syndrome should be recognized: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 2022 as ``World Down Syndrome Month'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of World Down Syndrome 
        Month;
            (3) celebrates the significant contributions that 
        individuals with Down syndrome make to their families, their 
        communities, the United States, and the world;
            (4) is committed to promoting the health, education, 
        employment, well-being, community inclusion and support, and 
        inherent dignity of all children and adults with Down syndrome;
            (5) supports the advancement of scientific and medical 
        research benefitting individuals with Down syndrome through the 
        national and international endeavors of the National Institutes 
        of Health, including through the INCLUDE project, focused on 
        improving health outcomes for individuals with Down syndrome; 
        and
            (6) encourages awareness and education regarding Down 
        syndrome, including for new and expectant parents.
