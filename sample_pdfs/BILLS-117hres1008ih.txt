                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the goals and ideals of National Women's History Month.

Whereas the purpose of National Women's History Month is to increase awareness 
        and knowledge of women's involvement in history;
Whereas, as recently as the 1970s, women's history was rarely included in the 
        kindergarten through grade 12 curriculum and was not part of public 
        awareness;
Whereas the Education Task Force of the Sonoma County (California) Commission on 
        the Status of Women initiated a ``Women's History Week'' celebration in 
        1978 centered around International Women's History Day, which is 
        celebrated on March 8;
Whereas, in 1980, the National Women's History Project (now the National Women's 
        History Alliance) was founded in Sonoma County, California, by Molly 
        Murphy MacGregor, Mary Ruthsdotter, Maria Cuevas, Paula Hammett, and 
        Bette Morgan to broadcast women's historical achievements;
Whereas, National Women's History Project co-founder Mary Ruthsdotter, who 
        passed away in January 2010, was a leader in the effort to ensure the 
        inclusion of women's accomplishments in the Nation's history;
Whereas, in 1981, responding to the growing popularity of women's history 
        celebrations, Congress passed a resolution making Women's History Week a 
        national observance;
Whereas, during this time, using information provided by the National Women's 
        History Project, thousands of schools and communities joined in the 
        commemoration of National Women's History Week, with support and 
        encouragement from Governors, city councils, school boards, and 
        Congress;
Whereas, in 1987, the National Women's History Project petitioned Congress to 
        expand the national celebration to include the entire month of March;
Whereas educators, workplace program planners, parents, and community 
        organizations, in thousands of communities in the United States, under 
        the guidance of the National Women's History Project, have turned 
        National Women's History Month into a major local learning experience 
        and celebration;
Whereas the popularity of women's history celebrations has sparked a new 
        interest in uncovering women's forgotten heritage;
Whereas the President's Commission on the Celebration of Women in American 
        History was established to consider how best to acknowledge and 
        celebrate the roles and accomplishments of women in United States 
        history;
Whereas the National Women's History Museum was founded in 1996, as an 
        institution dedicated to preserving, interpreting, and celebrating the 
        diverse historic contributions of women, and integrating this rich 
        heritage fully into the Nation's teachings and history books;
Whereas the first women's rights convention was held in Seneca Falls, New York, 
        in 1848, marking the official start to the women's suffrage movement 
        which would extend over the course of the next 72 years;
Whereas Johnstown, New York, was home to one of the most vocal advocates for 
        women's suffrage, Elizabeth Cady Stanton;
Whereas the House of Representatives recognizes March 2022 as National Women's 
        History Month; and
Whereas the theme of National Women's History Month 2022 is ``Women Providing 
        Healing, Promoting Hope'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Women's 
        History Month; and
            (2) recognizes and honors the women and organizations in 
        the United States that have fought for, and continue to 
        promote, the teaching of women's history.
