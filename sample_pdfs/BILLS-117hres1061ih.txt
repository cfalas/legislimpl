                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the goals and ideals of National Deaf History Month.

Whereas the purpose of National Deaf History Month is to increase awareness of 
        and express appreciation for the many contributions that deaf and hard-
        of-hearing individuals have made to our society;
Whereas, according to 2017 Census Bureau estimates, at least 11,200,000 
        individuals in the United States are deaf or hard of hearing;
Whereas deaf culture is an important part of the fabric of our society;
Whereas deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals have made and continue to make 
        numerous contributions to the United States;
Whereas the American School for the Deaf opened in Hartford, Connecticut, on 
        April 15, 1817, as the first public school for the deaf in the United 
        States;
Whereas Gallaudet University was founded on April 8, 1864, when President 
        Lincoln signed the charter establishing it as the first college for the 
        deaf in the world; and
Whereas the National Association of the Deaf and the American Library 
        Association support recognizing April as National Deaf History Month: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Deaf History 
        Month;
            (2) recognizes the many contributions that deaf and hard-
        of-hearing individuals have made to the United States; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Deaf History Month with appropriate programs and 
        activities.
