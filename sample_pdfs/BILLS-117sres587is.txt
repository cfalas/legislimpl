   Honoring the memory of Jereima ``Jeri'' Bustamante on the fourth 
                      anniversary of her passing.

Whereas Jereima ``Jeri'' Bustamante (referred to in this preamble as ``Jeri 
        Bustamante'') lived the American Dream;
Whereas, after moving from Panama to the United States with her family, Jeri 
        Bustamante--

    (1) attended Miami Beach Senior High School; and

    (2) earned a Bachelor's Degree in Communication and Media Sciences and 
a Master's Degree in Public Administration from Florida International 
University;

Whereas Jeri Bustamante had a tireless work ethic and a passion for 
        communication and paid for her education by working while enrolled in 
        school;
Whereas that tireless work ethic propelled Jeri Bustamante to professional 
        success, beginning with an internship at a Miami television station and 
        culminating in a period of service as press secretary to Governor Rick 
        Scott;
Whereas the enthusiasm, compassion, tenacity, and vibrant energy of Jeri 
        Bustamante are greatly missed by her family, friends, and coworkers;
Whereas the spirit of Jeri Bustamante lives on through the Jereima Bustamante 
        Memorial Scholarship, which aims to help graduates of Miami Beach Senior 
        High School achieve their goals and pursue the American Dream through a 
        college education; and
Whereas April 8, 2022, marks 4 years since the life of Jeri Bustamante was 
        tragically cut short in a fatal boating accident: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors the life and memory of Jereima ``Jeri'' 
        Bustamante (referred to in this resolution as ``Jeri 
        Bustamante'');
            (2) offers heartfelt condolences to the family, loved ones, 
        and friends of Jeri Bustamante;
            (3) recognizes that living the American Dream remains 
        possible for any individual who, following the example of Jeri 
        Bustamante, works hard to pursue and achieve a goal; and
            (4) encourages the recipients of the Jereima Bustamante 
        Memorial Scholarship to carry on the legacy of Jeri Bustamante.
