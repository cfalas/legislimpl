                               RESOLUTION


 
     Expressing support for the designation of April 14, 2022, as 
                        ``Remanufacturing Day''.

Whereas remanufacturing is a comprehensive and rigorous industrial process by 
        which a previously sold, leased, used, worn, remanufactured, or 
        nonfunctional product or part is returned to a like-new, same-as-when-
        new, or better-than-when-new condition, from both a quality and 
        performance perspective, through a controlled, reproducible, and 
        sustainable process;
Whereas a 2012 United States International Trade Commission (ITC) report found 
        that remanufacturers support at least 180,000 full-time jobs in the 
        United States, and the ITC report states that production of 
        remanufactured goods in the United States increased by 15 percent from 
        2009 to 2011 and exports totaled $11.2 billion annually;
Whereas remanufacturing has been recognized by leading universities, research 
        institutions, and manufacturers in the United States as good for the 
        environment for its ability to divert end-of-life products from 
        landfills;
Whereas, by encouraging businesses, State agencies, nonprofit organizations, 
        schools, and individuals to celebrate ``Remanufacturing Day'' in 2022, 
        we can further promote remanufacturing as environmentally friendly and 
        economically smart; and
Whereas, to focus the Nation's attention on the benefits of remanufacturing, 
        businesses, educational institutions, and nonprofit organizations have 
        joined together to celebrate ``Remanufacturing Day'' and are encouraging 
        their colleagues, friends and families, and their communities to learn 
        more about the benefits of remanufactured products: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``Remanufacturing Day''.
