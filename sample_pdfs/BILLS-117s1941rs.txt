SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Metropolitan Areas Protection and 
Standardization Act of 2021'' or the ``MAPS Act of 2021''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Federal programs use core-based statistical area 
        delineations to determine the delivery of Federal services, 
        benefits, and funding to people in the United States, such as 
        in criteria for eligibility or distribution.
            (2) Core-based statistical area delineations provide a 
        nationally consistent set of standards for collecting, 
        tabulating, and publishing Federal statistics for geographic 
        areas, and they are not intended for any public or private 
        sector non-statistical uses such as program administration or 
        service delivery.
            (3) Updates to core-based statistical area delineations may 
        cause widespread disruption to the delivery of Federal 
        services, benefits, and funding to people in the United States 
        based on the reliance of Federal programs on these 
        delineations.
            (4) There does not exist any comprehensive list of Federal 
        programs that rely on core-based statistical area delineations. 
        Such a list is valuable for the study of how Federal services, 
        benefits, and funding are distributed to people in the United 
        States.
            (5) Increased transparency on the impacts of any update to 
        core-based statistical area delineations may be overly 
        burdensome due to the anticipated variety of Federal programs 
        that rely on these delineations. Any requirement for complete 
        disclosure of these impacts prior to implementation of new 
        delineations may unintentionally cause the existing 
        delineations to ossify.
            (6) In order to prevent any disruption to service delivery 
        of Federal programs based on updates to core-based statistical 
        area delineations, and ensure the independence of Federal 
        statistical policymaking, Congress must sever the link between 
        future updates to core-based statistical area delineations and 
        any automatic impact on Federal programs that rely on these 
        delineations.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    This purpose of this Act is to ensure--
            (1) transparency in how core-based statistical area 
        delineations are used in domestic assistance programs; and
            (2) independence of the Office of Management and Budget in 
        establishing and updating core-based statistical area 
        delineations.

SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.

        Areas'', published in the Federal Register on July 16, 2021 (86 
        Fed. Reg. 37770), or any successor to that Notice.
            (4) Director.--The term ``Director'' means the Director of 
        the Office of Management and Budget.

        data asset'' has the meaning given the term in section 3502 of
