Recognizing the 47th anniversary of Black April and the Fall of Saigon 
                           on April 30, 1975.

Whereas since 1975, hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese have resettled in the 
        United States and built vibrant communities across the United States 
        which contribute to the rich diversity of the Nation;
Whereas, on April 30, 1975, the Republic of Vietnam was overthrown by communist 
        forces in an event known as ``Black April'' or the ``Fall of Saigon'', 
        which is observed in Vietnamese-American communities across the United 
        States each year;
Whereas members of the South Vietnamese military fought side by side with the 
        United States Armed Forces in defense of the ideals of democracy and 
        freedom;
Whereas Vietnamese Americans have continuously advocated for freedom and 
        democracy in Vietnam, and spoken out against human rights abuses by the 
        Vietnamese Government; and
Whereas Vietnam continues to hold one of the worst records on human rights in 
        the region, violating religious freedom, obstructing press freedom, 
        restricting its own citizens' freedom of speech and assembly, and 
        detaining prisoners of conscience: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the significance of the 47th anniversary of 
        Black April and the Fall of Saigon on April 30, 1975;
            (2) honors the contributions of Vietnamese Americans to the 
        United States over the last 47 years and their tireless 
        commitment to upholding freedom, human rights, and democracy in 
        Vietnam;
            (3) honors the service of members of the United States 
        Armed Forces and of the South Vietnamese forces who fought in 
        Vietnam, including those who gave their lives;
            (4) honors the memory of the Vietnamese who lost their 
        lives while attempting to flee Vietnam; and
            (5) encourages all citizens of the United States to join in 
        remembering Black April and the Fall of Saigon, honoring the 
        contributions of the Vietnamese-American community, and calling 
        for freedom, human rights, and democracy in Vietnam.
