        authorization to administer controlled substances.
            ``(4) Automatic termination.--A registration issued under 
        this subsection shall automatically terminate if the

        location' means, with respect to each registration issued to a 
        practitioner under subsection (f), the address that appears on 
        the certificate of registration.''.
