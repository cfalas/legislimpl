                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit the importation of petroleum products from Venezuela, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prohibit Venezuelan Oil Importation 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) From 1959 to 1999, Venezuela, officially known as the 
        Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, had a form of government that 
        embraced democratic principles.
            (2) In 1999, Hugo Chavez was elected as the President of 
        Venezuela, where he maintained power by redistributing the 
        country's vast oil reserves towards social welfare programs, 
        suppressing dissent and independent media, and corrupting 
        Venezuela's democratic institutions, while simultaneously 
        nationalizing the country's private businesses, which he did so 
        until his death on March 5, 2013.
            (3) On April 24, 2013, Nicolas Maduro became President of 
        Venezuela, notwithstanding multiple claims of election fraud 
        and constitutional violations against Maduro.
            (4) During this time, Venezuela's economy had become 
        strongly dependent on the exportation of oil, with crude 
        accounting for 86 percent of its exports.
            (5) However, in 2014, Venezuela entered into an economic 
        recession, which led to the Venezuelan regime's partnership 
        with Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), a state oil company, 
        to combat the highly fluctuating price of oil in Venezuela 
        along with the country's overall steep decrease in oil 
        production.
            (6) In 2015, Venezuela's economic struggles continued, with 
        Venezuela having the world's highest rate of inflation that 
        surpassed 100 percent, resulting from the Maduro regime's 
        socialist economic policy that ultimately redistributed the 
        oil-generated wealth to Venezuela's oligarchs.
            (7) In January 2016, Maduro declared an ``economic 
        emergency'' due to the country's inability to provide for basic 
        human needs to its citizens, leading to riots in the streets of 
        Venezuela.
            (8) In 2017, Maduro announced that leading opposition 
        parties would be barred from taking part in the country's 
        Presidential election, which led the United States and other 
        countries formally recognizing Juan Guaido as the President of 
        Venezuela, although countries such as China, Russia, Cuba, and 
        Iran still continued to recognize President Nicolas Maduro.
            (9) In August 2019, President Donald Trump signed an 
        Executive order to impose tough sanctions against Maduro's 
        totalitarian regime.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that Congress--
            (1) recognizes that Venezuela has been impacted by 
        hyperinflation, rampant crime, and significant government 
        corruption;
            (2) condemns the totalitarian Maduro regime and calls for 
        the return of constitutional democratic government to Venezuela 
        similar to the form of government that existed in the country 
        from 1959 to 1999; and
            (3) calls on President Joseph Biden to use relevant 
        constitutional and statutory authorities that grant emergency 
        powers to waive unnecessary environmental permitting 
        requirements until the United States can reliably produce 
        enough oil and natural gas to recapture America's global energy 
        dominance.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It shall be the policy of the United States--
            (1) to support the desire of the people of Venezuela for 
        freedom and democracy;
            (2) to promote its national security interests by 
        prohibiting the importation of petroleum products from 
        Venezuela in the midst of the ongoing Russian attack on 
        Ukraine;
            (3) to stress the importance of American energy 
        independence, particularly from countries such as Russia and 
        Venezuela; and
            (4) to implement America-first energy policies that 
        contradict President Biden's overall energy policy approach.

SEC. 4. PROHIBITION ON IMPORTATION OF PETROLEUM PRODUCTS FROM 
              VENEZUELA.

    (a) In General.--The President shall prohibit the importation of 
all petroleum products (as such term is defined in section 3 of the 
Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6202)) originating from 
Venezuela into the customs territory of the United States (as such term 
is defined in General Note 2 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule).
    (b) Modification or Removal of Prohibition.--The President may 
modify or remove the prohibition under subsection (a) with respect to 
some or all petroleum products described in such subsection only if the 
President--
            (1) reimplements and maintains the sanctions imposed 
        against Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA);
            (2) directs the Executive Office of the President to 
        conduct and submit to the appropriate congressional committees 
        and leadership a study that--
                    (A) outlines the impacts and implications of

            (5) notifies the appropriate congressional committees and 
        leadership that, in the determination of the President, such 
        modification or removal is appropriate given the situation in 
        Ukraine, and includes with such notification--
                    (A) an explanation of the rationale for such 
                modification or removal; and

                removal of the prohibition, a description of the 
                criteria to be met by Venezuela for further
