                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the creation of the Purdue ``All-
            American'' Marching Band's World's Largest Drum.

Whereas the World's Largest Drum is a significant piece of the ``All-American'' 
        Marching Band and an icon of Purdue University;
Whereas, in 1921, ``All-American'' Marching Band Director Paul Spotts Emrick 
        commissioned the World's Largest Drum from the Leedy Corporation of 
        Indianapolis;
Whereas, in 1921, the World's Largest Drum was the largest drum in existence and 
        was displayed at the Indiana Statehouse and Indiana State Fair;
Whereas it is a Purdue ``All-American'' Marching Band tradition to honor 
        national leaders and heroes with the privilege to beat the World's 
        Largest Drum, with President Harry Truman, Gus Grissom, and Neil 
        Armstrong being among those accepting the invitation; and
Whereas the World's Largest Drum is an essential element of the ``All-American'' 
        Marching Band's performances across Indiana, the United States, and the 
        world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the Purdue ``All-American'' Marching Band, which is 
        celebrating the 100th anniversary of the construction of the 
        World's Largest Drum, continues to remain an important cultural 
        and historical icon of Purdue University and the State of 
        Indiana;
            (2) the World's Largest Drum deserves recognition for the 
        continued legacies of excellence and discipline exhibited by 
        the World's Largest Drum crew and the Purdue ``All-American'' 
        Marching Band; and
            (3) continued admiration of the World's Largest Drum 
        exemplifies the spirit of ingenuity of the people of the United 
        States to push the bounds of engineering and create new 
        products.
