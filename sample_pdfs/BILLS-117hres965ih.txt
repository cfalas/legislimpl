                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of the week beginning March 6, 
                 2022, as ``School Social Work Week''.

Whereas the importance of school social work through the inclusion of school 
        social work programs and services has been recognized in the Elementary 
        and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) and the 
        Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1400 et seq.);
Whereas school social workers are especially skilled in providing services to 
        students who face serious challenges to school success, including 
        disability, poverty, discrimination, abuse, neglect, mental illness, 
        homelessness, bullying, familial stressors, and other barriers to 
        learning;
Whereas school social workers are needed more now than at any time in recent 
        memory, as more students are struggling with mental and behavioral 
        health disorders, with nearly 1 in 6 children from 2 to 8 years old 
        (17.4 percent) having a diagnosed mental, behavioral, or developmental 
        disorder;
Whereas individuals who wish to access community mental health services often 
        find such services unavailable, inaccessible, or inadequate;
Whereas school-based mental health programs are critical to early identification 
        of and early intervention for mental health problems;
Whereas school social workers, being licensed mental health professionals in 
        schools in the United States, provide necessary assessment, 
        interventions, counseling, family outreach, and community referrals;
Whereas school mental health programs are critical to early identification of 
        mental health problems and in the provision of appropriate services when 
        needed;
Whereas school social workers maintain knowledge of school culture and school 
        climate which are necessary for responsible school safety planning;
Whereas fewer than 1 in 5 children in need of mental health services actually 
        receive these services, and research indicates that school mental health 
        programs improve educational outcomes by decreasing absences, dropout 
        rates, and discipline referrals, while improving academic achievement;
Whereas school social workers serve as vital members of a school's education 
        team, playing a central role in creating partnerships between the home, 
        school, and community to ensure student academic success; and
Whereas the celebration of ``School Social Work Week'' during the week beginning 
        March 6, 2022, highlights the vital role school social workers play in 
        the lives of students in the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``School Social Work 
        Week'';
            (2) honors and recognizes the contributions of school 
        social workers to the successes of students in schools across 
        the Nation; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``School Social Work Week'' with appropriate ceremonies and 
        activities that promote awareness of the vital role of school 
        social workers, in schools and in the community as a whole, in 
        helping students prepare for their futures as productive 
        citizens.
