                               RESOLUTION


 
Recognizing the erroneous and misleading allegations in the October 19, 
  2020, ``Public Statement on the Hunter Biden Emails'' signed by 51 
                     former intelligence officials.

Whereas, on October 14, 2020, the New York Post exclusively reported on a ``. . 
        . massive trove of data recovered from a laptop computer'' belonging to 
        Hunter Biden;
Whereas, on October 19, 2020, 51 current and former intelligence officials 
        signed and released a ``Public Statement on the Hunter Biden Emails'', 
        which announced that the emails uncovered on Hunter Biden's laptop ``. . 
        . [have] all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation'';
Whereas the signatories include Jim Clapper, Mike Hayden, Leon Panetta, John 
        Brennan, Thomas Finger, Rick Ledgett, John McLaughlin, Michael Morell, 
        Mike Vickers, Doug Wise, Nick Rasmussen, Russ Travers, Andy Liepman, 
        John Moseman, Larry Pfeiffer, Jeremy Bash, Rodney Snyder, Glenn 
        Gerstell, David B. Buckley, Nada Bakos, Patty Brandmaier, James B. 
        Bruce, David Cariens, Janice Cariens, Paul Kolbe, Peter Corsell, Brett 
        Davis, Roger Zane George, Steven L. Hall, Kent Harrington, Don Hepburn, 
        Timothy D. Kilbourn, Ron Marks, Jonna Hiestand Mendez, Emile Nakhleh, 
        Gerald A. O'Shea, David Priess, Pam Purcilly, Marc Polymeropoulos, Chris 
        Savos, Nick Shapiro, John Sipher, Stephen Slick, Cynthia Strand, Greg 
        Tarbell, David Terry, Greg Treverton, John Tullius, David A. Vanell, 
        Winston Wiley, and Kristin Wood;
Whereas the verification of doubts surrounding a developing story published by 
        the New York Post story was not proven at the writing of the ``Public 
        Statement of Hunter Biden Emails'';
Whereas the distribution of this letter occurred 15 days before the 2020 
        Presidential election;
Whereas using authorized access as a platform to discredit legitimate reporting 
        has falsely informed the public prior to the outcome of the 2020 
        Presidential election;
Whereas, on October 19, 2020, Director of National Intelligence, John Ratcliffe, 
        appeared on a televised interview with Fox Business, where he declared 
        that ``Hunter Biden's laptop is not part of some Russian disinformation 
        campaign, and I think it's clear that the American people know that'';
Whereas Twitter locked the New York Post's account for seven days following the 
        October 2020 report;
Whereas, on April 8, 2021, the Daily Mail reported that ``103,000 text messages, 
        154,000 emails, more than 2,000 photos and dozens of videos'' from 
        Hunter Biden's laptop were authenticated by forensic experts;
Whereas, on March 17, 2022, the New York Times published an article tacitly 
        referring to these same legitimate emails found on Hunter Biden's 
        laptop, which are being used in a grand jury probe into his finances;
Whereas, on March 22, 2022, 4 of the 51 signatories have issued sustained 
        support of their letter, since the New York Times March 17th article, 
        which passively verified the data discovered on Hunter Biden's ``Russian 
        Disinformation'' laptop; and
Whereas this resolution shall be known as the ``Spook Who Cried Wolf 
        Resolution'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives that 
the 51 signatories of the letter who publicly and falsely decried 
Hunter Biden's laptop to be Russian disinformation should be barred 
from holding any level of security clearances indefinitely.
