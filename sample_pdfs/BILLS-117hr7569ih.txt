                                 A BILL


 
  To direct the Secretary of Energy to establish a program to provide 
financial assistance to graduate students and postdoctoral researchers 
pursuing certain courses of study relating to cybersecurity and energy 
                            infrastructure.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Cybersecurity University 
Leadership Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. ENERGY CYBERSECURITY UNIVERSITY LEADERSHIP PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) Addressing cybersecurity vulnerabilities in energy-
        related critical infrastructure after an intrusion occurs is 
        inefficient, ineffective, and costly.
            (2) Integrating cybersecurity considerations into the 
        research, design, and development of energy infrastructure 
        represents a cost-effective approach to enhancing the security, 
        resilience, and reliability of the electric grid, oil and 
        natural gas pipelines, and other energy distribution, 
        transmission, and generation systems.
            (3) Successfully employing the approach outlined in 
        paragraph (2) as a guiding principle for the Department's 
        energy infrastructure activities will require a diverse, 
        inclusive, and highly skilled workforce which possesses energy-
        specific cybersecurity expertise and familiarity with 
        associated research, development, and demonstration needs.
            (4) A dedicated science scholarship program at the 
        Department for graduate students and postdoctoral researchers 
        studying energy-specific cybersecurity disciplines could help 
        address the challenges stated in paragraphs (1) through (3).
    (b) Program.--
            (1) Establishment.--The Secretary of Energy shall establish 
        an Energy Cybersecurity University Leadership Program (referred 
        to in this section as the ``Program'') to carry out the 
        activities described in paragraph (2).
            (2) Program activities.--The Secretary shall--
                    (A) provide financial assistance, on a competitive 
                basis, for scholarships, fellowships, and research and 
                development projects at institutions of higher 
                education to support graduate students and postdoctoral 
                researchers pursuing a course of study that integrates 
                cybersecurity competencies within disciplines 
                associated with energy infrastructure needs;
                    (B) provide graduate students and postdoctoral 
                researchers supported under the Program with research 
                traineeship experiences at National Laboratories and 
                utilities; and
                    (C) conduct outreach to historically Black colleges 
                and universities, Tribal Colleges or Universities, and 
                minority-serving institutions.
    (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of the enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Science, 
Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee 
on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate a report on the 
development and implementation of the Program.
    (d) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Department.--The term ``Department'' means the 
        Department of Energy.
