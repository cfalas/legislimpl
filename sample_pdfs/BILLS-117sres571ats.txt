                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the goals and ideals of Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary 
                       Embolism Awareness Month.

Whereas deep vein thrombosis (referred to in this preamble as ``DVT'') is a 
        condition that occurs when a blood clot forms in the deep veins of the 
        body, such as in the arm, abdomen, around the brain, and most commonly 
        in the leg;
Whereas a potentially life-threatening complication of DVT is pulmonary embolism 
        (referred to in this preamble as ``PE''), where a blood clot breaks off, 
        travels through the blood stream, and lodges in the lung;
Whereas DVT and PE are serious but often preventable medical conditions;
Whereas DVT and PE affect as many as 900,000 individuals in the United States 
        each year;
Whereas DVT and PE kill an estimated 60,000 to 100,000 individuals in the United 
        States each year, and 1 out of 4 individuals who have a PE die without 
        warning;
Whereas DVT and PE deaths are often preventable;
Whereas DVT and PE are the leading causes of preventable hospital death in the 
        United States;
Whereas DVT and PE are a common complication faced by cancer patients, and 
        survival rates are lower for individuals with cancer who also have blood 
        clots;
Whereas pregnancy increases the risk of DVT and PE, and that risk remains 
        elevated for up to 3 months after giving birth;
Whereas immobility, surgery, older age, and a family history of clotting and 
        thrombophilia increase the risk of DVT and PE;
Whereas DVT and PE contributes to up to $10,000,000,000 in incremental medical 
        costs each year in the United States; and
Whereas the establishment of March as Deep Vein Thrombosis and Pulmonary 
        Embolism Awareness Month would raise awareness about this life-
        threatening but preventable condition: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Deep Vein Thrombosis 
        and Pulmonary Embolism Awareness Month; and
            (2) recognizes the importance of raising awareness of deep 
        vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism.
