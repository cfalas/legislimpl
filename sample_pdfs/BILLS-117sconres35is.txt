                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Supporting the goals and ideals of International Transgender Day of 
                              Visibility.

Whereas International Transgender Day of Visibility was founded in 2009 to honor 
        the achievements and contributions of the transgender community;
Whereas International Transgender Day of Visibility is designed to be 
        encompassing of a large community of individuals, including individuals 
        who identify as nonbinary, gender-nonconforming, and gender-diverse;
Whereas International Transgender Day of Visibility is a time to celebrate the 
        lives and achievements of transgender, nonbinary, gender-nonconforming, 
        and gender-diverse individuals around the world, and to recognize the 
        bravery it takes to live openly and authentically;
Whereas International Transgender Day of Visibility is also a time to raise 
        awareness of the discrimination and violence that the transgender 
        community still faces, which make it difficult and even unsafe or fatal 
        for many transgender individuals to be visible;
Whereas the transgender community has suffered oppression disproportionately in 
        many ways, including--

    (1) discrimination in the workplace;

    (2) discrimination in educational institutions; and

    (3) subjection to violence;

Whereas forms of transgender oppression are exacerbated for transgender 
        individuals of color, individuals with limited resources, immigrants, 
        individuals living with disabilities, justice-involved individuals, and 
        transgender youth;
Whereas a record number of anti-transgender State bills have been introduced in 
        recent years;
Whereas the transgender community has made it clear that transgender individuals 
        will not be erased and deserve to be accorded all of the rights and 
        opportunities made available to all;
Whereas, before the creation of the United States, Indigenous two-spirit, 
        transgender, nonbinary, gender-nonconforming, and gender-diverse 
        individuals existed across North America in many Native American 
        communities;
Whereas many Native American communities have specific terms in their own 
        languages for the gender-variant members of their communities and the 
        social and spiritual roles these individuals fulfill;
Whereas, while many two-spirit and gender-variant traditions in Native American 
        communities were lost or actively suppressed by the efforts of 
        missionaries, government agents, boarding schools, and settlers, many of 
        these traditions have seen a revival in recent decades;
Whereas transgender, nonbinary, gender-nonconforming, and gender-diverse 
        individuals continue to bravely tell their stories and push for full 
        equity under the law;
Whereas the civil-rights struggle has been strengthened and inspired by the 
        leadership of the transgender community;
Whereas 23 States have at least 1 transgender elected official, and there are 12 
        transgender, gender-nonconforming, or nonbinary elected officials in 
        State legislatures, including--

    (1) Danica Roem;

    (2) Gerri Cannon;

    (3) Cesar Chavez;

    (4) Brianna Titone;

    (5) Lisa Bunker;

    (6) Joshua Query;

    (7) Sarah McBride;

    (8) Stephanie Byers;

    (9) Taylor Small;

    (10) Mauree Turner;

    (11) Stacie Laughton; and

    (12) Mike Simmons;

Whereas voters in the State of Delaware elected Sarah McBride as the first 
        openly transgender State senator in the United States;
Whereas voters in the State of Oklahoma elected Mauree Turner as the first 
        openly nonbinary State legislator in the United States;
Whereas, in the State of Illinois, Mike Simmons became the first openly 
        nonbinary or gender-nonconforming State senator in the United States;
Whereas 4 States have a transgender jurist on the bench, including--

    (1) Judge Phyllis Frye of Texas;

    (2) Judge Victoria Kolakowski of California;

    (3) Commissioner Tracy Nadzieja of Arizona; and

    (4) Judge Jill Rose Quinn of Illinois;

Whereas Admiral Rachel L. Levine, MD, was the first openly transgender Federal 
        official confirmed by the United States Senate and is the highest 
        ranking openly transgender Federal Government official in the history of 
        the United States;
Whereas Stella Keating became the first transgender teen to testify before the 
        United States Senate;
Whereas more transgender individuals are gracing the covers of magazines to 
        raise awareness of their gender identity and the importance of living 
        authentically;
Whereas transgender individuals have created culture and history as artists, 
        musicians, healers, workers, and organizers; and
Whereas International Transgender Day of Visibility is a time to celebrate the 
        transgender community around the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of International 
        Transgender Day of Visibility;
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        International Transgender Day of Visibility with appropriate 
        ceremonies, programs, and activities;
            (3) celebrates the accomplishments and leadership of 
        transgender, nonbinary, gender-nonconforming, and gender-
        diverse individuals; and
            (4) recognizes the bravery of the transgender community as 
        it fights for equal dignity and respect.
