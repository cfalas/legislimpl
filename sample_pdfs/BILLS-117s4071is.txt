            (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human 
        Services shall seek to enter into an agreement with the 
        National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
        (referred to in this section as the ``National Academies'') to 
        examine and report on European Union safety and efficacy 
        reviews of drugs for rare diseases and conditions, the use and 
        sufficiency of existing mechanisms and tools of the Food and 
        Drug Administration in ensuring that patient and physician 
        perspectives are considered throughout such reviews, and 
        opportunities to improve such reviews in the United States.
            (2) Content.--The report developed under paragraph (1) 
        shall--
                    (A) assess and evaluate, with respect to drugs for 
                rare diseases and conditions--
                            (i) any flexibilities, authorities, or 
                        mechanisms available in the European Union;
                            (ii) consideration and use by the European 
                        Medicines Agency of supplemental data submitted 
                        during the orphan drug application review 
                        process, including data associated with open 
                        label extension studies and expanded access 
                        programs; and
                            (iii) each formal or informal process that 
                        the Food and Drug Administration has utilized 
                        to gather external expertise on orphan drug 
                        applications, separately considering orphan 
                        drugs for diseases or conditions that affect 
                        fewer than 20,000 individuals in the United 
                        States, compared to orphan drugs for other rare

                    (B) provide recommendations for changes to the 
                processes and authorities of the Food and Drug 
                Administration to facilitate development of, and access 
                to, orphan drugs, which may include--
                            (i) new tools or mechanisms to improve 
                        efforts and initiatives of the Food and Drug 
                        Administration to collect and consider external 
                        expertise on orphan drug applications, 
                        separately considering treatments for diseases 
                        or conditions that affect fewer than 20,000 
                        individuals in the United States, including 
                        with respect to processes related to 
                        application review, including structured 
                        benefit-risk assessments, advisory committee 
                        deliberations, and postapproval safety 
                        monitoring; and

                        clinical and research experts available with 
                        respect to a rare disease or condition, setting 
                        forth alternative processes to address or 
                        resolve any conflicts of interest that would 
                        otherwise impede inclusion of input from such 
                        external experts.
