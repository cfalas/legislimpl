 Honoring the lives of fallen Missouri police officers and expressing 
                     condolences to their families.

Whereas police officers, sheriffs and deputies, and other law enforcement 
        officers serve and protect their communities with honor and sacrifice;
Whereas all individuals in law enforcement put their lives on the line while 
        serving and protecting their local communities;
Whereas when violent crime increases, law enforcement officers and the 
        communities they serve are directly impacted;
Whereas, in the month of March 2022, Missouri experienced violent attacks 
        against police officers, especially in rural areas;
Whereas, in a 20-day period, 6 police officers in Missouri were shot in the line 
        of duty, 3 of whom suffered injuries that were fatal; and
Whereas these fallen officers include--

    (1) Corporal Benjamin Lee Cooper of the Joplin Police Department, who 
passed away in the line of duty on March 8, 2022, after attempting to take 
a suspect into custody;

    (2) Police Officer Jake Alexander Reed of the Joplin Police Department, 
who passed away from injuries sustained in the line of duty on March 11, 
2022, after attempting to take a suspect into custody; and

    (3) Patrolman Lane Anthony Burns of the Bonne Terre Police Department, 
who passed away in the line of duty on March 17, 2022, after responding to 
a disturbance: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses deep condolences for the Missouri police 
        officers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty;
            (2) recognizes the countless selfless and heroic actions 
        carried out by local law enforcement officers;
            (3) expresses strong support for police officers and law 
        enforcement officers in rural areas and across the United 
        States that serve and protect their local communities;
            (4) recognizes the need to ensure that rural law 
        enforcement departments have the proper equipment, training, 
        and resources necessary to protect officers and the individuals 
        in the communities they serve;
            (5) acknowledges the importance of honoring and remembering 
        fallen police and local law enforcement officers killed in the 
        line of duty; and
            (6) expresses condolences to the loved ones of each law 
        enforcement officer across the United States who has made the 
        ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty and whose sacrifice will 
        not be forgotten.
