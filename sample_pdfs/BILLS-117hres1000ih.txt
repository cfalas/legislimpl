                               RESOLUTION


 
 Calling on the President to deter further Russian aggression against 
 Ukraine, particularly the threat of nuclear, biological, or chemical 
                                attacks.

Whereas the Russian Federation is currently engaged in a brutal, illegal, 
        premeditated, and destructive war against the sovereign, democratic 
        country of Ukraine;
Whereas the Russian Federation's war against Ukraine is in gross, clear, and 
        uncorrected violation of the principles of the Helsinki Final Act, in 
        contravention of the United Nations Charter, in violation of its 
        obligations under the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, and an unmitigated moral 
        stain on its countenance;
Whereas the Russian leadership has made numerous implied and overt threats 
        regarding the potential use of nuclear, biological, or chemical weapons 
        of mass destruction in connection with its barbaric war on Ukraine;
Whereas the Russian war on Ukraine is not only a humanitarian catastrophe and a 
        global and national security crisis, but also a direct and potentially 
        irreparable threat to global nonproliferation, including notorious and 
        gross Russian violations of its obligations under the Budapest 
        Memorandums and the conduct of a civilized state;
Whereas, in exchange for Ukraine eliminating all nuclear weapons from its 
        territory, the 1994 Budapest Memorandum committed its signatories, the 
        Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, and the United States, to 
        refrain from the threat or use of force or economic coercion against 
        Ukraine, and provided guarantees for the independence and sovereignty 
        and territorial integrity of Ukraine;
Whereas the employment of chemical or biological weapons by the Russian 
        Federation would be in violation of its obligations under the Chemical 
        Weapons Convention, the Geneva Protocol, and the Biological Weapons 
        Convention; and
Whereas the United States does not seek war, and urges an immediate end to 
        Russian aggression in and against Ukraine, but the Russian military's 
        potential use of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons of mass 
        destruction constitutes grave escalation over redlines that imperil 
        United States national security and international peace: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) calls upon the President to declare that the Russian 
        employment of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons of mass 
        destruction (WMDs), including low-yield ``tactical'' nuclear 
        weapons, ``false flag'' operations utilizing WMDs, and the 
        purposeful or deliberate targeting or neglect of nuclear 
        facilities that leads to a nuclear event, against or in 
        connection with its war on Ukraine would represent crimes 
        against humanity;
            (2) calls upon the President to treat such crimes against 
        humanity as an urgent national and global security threat that 
        may require, in concert with North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        allies, the employment of any available conventional means as 
        necessary to secure the peace, including the potential need to 
        degrade and destroy offending Russian forces in Ukraine;
            (3) calls upon the President to make immediate efforts to 
        provide the military and other material means needed for the 
        legitimate democratic Government of Ukraine to be able to 
        defend its national sovereignty; and
            (4) stands ready to make additional appropriations or 
        legislation to meet the needs of securing Ukraine's, Europe's, 
        and the United States common struggle against Russian fascism.
