                                 A BILL


 
 To require the Secretary of Transportation to conduct a study on the 
significant improvements and potential alternatives necessary to offset 
 extended closures associated with Interstate Route 70, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``I-70 Detour Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Interstate Route 70 is the gateway to the Rocky 
        Mountains and a major east-west interstate highway that runs 
        through and connects 10 different states from Baltimore, 
        Maryland, to Cove Fort, Utah.
            (2) Because of natural hazards, Interstate Route 70 through 
        Glenwood experiences significant closures that last greater 
        than 1 week, three or four times a decade.
            (3) Substantial improvements to existing roads and possible 
        alternative routes should be studied and then funded in a 
        timely manner to ensure the continuation of commerce as well as 
        the safe movement of goods and people in the event that 
        Interstate Route 70 is shut down again in the future.
            (4) Closures of Interstate Route 70 are extremely costly, 
        with an economic impact estimated at $1 million per hour.
            (5) At this time, the local counties directly impacted by 
        these closures and some of the alternatives proposed in this 
        bill prefer for any county route or county road impacted by 
        this bill to remain under county control and not become a state 
        highway.

SEC. 3. ALTERNATIVES.

    (a) Report.--
            (1) In general.--As soon as practicable, but not later than 
        2 years after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary
