BILL 
TO 
Require the United Kingdom to achieve climate and nature targets; to give 
the Secretary of State a duty to implement a strategy to achieve those targets; 
to establish a Climate and Nature Assembly to advise the Secretary of State 
in creating that strategy; to give duties to the Committee on Climate Change 
and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee regarding the strategy and 
targets; and for connected purposes. 
B E IT ENACTED by the Queen’s most Excellent Majesty, by and with the advice 
and consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, in this present 
Parliament assembled, and by the authority of the same, as follows:— 
1 Duty of the Secretary of State: climate and nature targets 
(1) The Secretary of State must achieve the objectives in subsection (2) (‘the 
objectives’). 
(2) The objectives are to ensure that the United Kingdom— 
(a) reduces its overall contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions 5
(‘emissions’) at a rate consistent with— 
(i) limiting the global mean temperature increase to 1.5 degrees 
Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels; and 
(ii) 
10
fulfilling its obligations under the UNFCCC and the Paris 
Agreement, taking into account the United Kingdom’s and 
other countries’— 
(A) historical emissions; 
(B) common but differentiated responsibilities; and 
(C) 
15
respective capabilities, considering national 
circumstances; 
(‘the climate target’); and 
(b) halts and reverses its overall contribution to the degradation and loss 
of nature in the United Kingdom and overseas, thereby— 
(i) 
20
increasing the health, abundance, diversity and resilience of 
species, populations, habitats and ecosystems so that by 2030 
nature is visibly and measurably on the path of recovery, and— 
(ii) fulfilling its obligations under the UNCBD and its protocols, 
1 
following the commitments set out in the Leaders’ Pledge for 
Bill 61 58/2 
Climate and Ecology Bill 1 
Nature, taking into account the United Kingdom’s and other 
countries’— 
(A) historical contributions to the degradation of nature; 
(B) common but differentiated responsibilities; and 
(C) respective capabilities, considering national 5
circumstances; 
(‘the nature target’). 
(3) The duty applies to matters of devolved legislative competency subject to 
section 5. 
2 Duty of the Secretary of State: climate and nature strategy 10
(1) The Secretary of State must, within twelve months of the passing of this Act, 
publish and lay before Parliament a strategy (‘the strategy’) to achieve the 
objectives specified in section 1. 
(2) 
15
The strategy must include annual interim targets consistent with the 
achievement of the objectives and the Secretary of State must take all 
reasonable steps to meet those annual interim targets. 
(3) The strategy must include measures that, in the opinion of the Secretary of 
State, and subject to sections 3 and 4, will achieve the objectives specified in 
section 1 by— 
(a) reducing greenhouse gas emissions from sources caused by human 20
activity as far and as rapidly as possible; 
(b) ensuring that the UK’s emissions are calculated on the basis of UK 
consumption and include international aviation and passenger 
shipping; 
(c) ensuring that steps taken to mitigate emissions minimise, as far as 25
possible, damage to ecosystems, food and water availability, and 
human health; 
(d) ensuring that steps taken to increase the health, abundance, diversity 
30
and resilience of species, populations and ecosystems follow the 
mitigation and conservation hierarchy, with avoidance of the loss of 
nature prioritised; 
(e) restoring and expanding natural ecosystems, and enhancing the 
management of cultivated ecosystems to protect and enhance 
35
biodiversity, ecological processes and ecosystem service provision, 
including climate change mitigation; 
(f) including measures to protect, restore and enhance ecosystems in the 
United Kingdom (and elsewhere, when activity generated from within 
the United Kingdom is harmful to such ecosystems); 
(g) 
40
ending the exploration, extraction, export and import of fossil fuels 
by the United Kingdom as rapidly as possible; and 
(h) taking every possible step to avoid, limit—and where limiting is not 
possible—compensate for the adverse impacts of United 
Kingdom-generated cycles of consumption, trade, financing and 
1 
production on ecosystems and human health; including, but not limited 
2 Climate and Ecology Bill 
to, the extraction of raw materials, deforestation, land degradation, 
pollution and waste production. 
(4) The measures in the strategy must— 
(a) be projected to have a net positive impact on— 
(i) local communities, including those with a high deprivation 5
rating according to Government deprivation indices; 
(ii) young people; and 
(iii) people with protected characteristics under section 4 of the 
Equality Act 2010; and 
(b) include sufficient financial support and retraining for people whose 10
livelihoods and jobs will be affected by the proposed measures, 
including those measures that require transitioning out of industries 
characterised by high emissions and high impacts on ecosystems. 
(5) 
15
The strategy may include measures in areas of devolved legislative competency 
subject to section 5. 
3 Public involvement 
(1) The Secretary of State must, within two months of the passing of this Act,

try to reach agreement with the Assembly on a proposal to include 
that recommendation in the strategy; 
(b) at least 80% of the Assembly, the CCC or JNCC must agree to propose 30
the inclusion of that recommendation in the strategy unless in their
