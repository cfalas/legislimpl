                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the designation of Vaisakhi, April 14 of each year, as 
                         ``National Sikh Day''.

Whereas the United States is enriched by the diversity of its residents, who 
        have cultivated a climate of social tolerance and intellectual pluralism 
        that has sustained the Nation throughout its history;
Whereas the Sikh community, which originated in Punjab, India, and began 
        immigrating into the United States over 100 years ago, has played an 
        important role in developing the United States;
Whereas Sikhism is the world's fifth-largest religion with nearly 30,000,000 
        adherents, roughly 1,000,000 of whom call the United States home;
Whereas, founded by Guru Nanak in the Punjab region of India during the 15th 
        century, the Sikh spiritual tradition is rooted in the belief that every 
        person, regardless of race, gender, sex, or creed, is equal before God;
Whereas believing that every person shares a connection through the oneness of 
        God, the Sikh community emerged as a force for social justice by 
        encouraging female participation in religious services and initiating 
        interfaith efforts to combat oppression and injustice;
Whereas the Sikh religion's central principles of truthful living, service to 
        humanity, and devotion to God also inspire its believers to create 
        inclusive communities where all are respected;
Whereas through leading charitable events, the Sikh community embodies the sense 
        of public service that underlies the founding principles of the United 
        States;
Whereas the people of the United States feel obliged to honor the Sikh 
        community's important role in supporting and enriching the social fabric 
        of the Nation;
Whereas Sikhs celebrate Vaisakhi on the first day of the month of Vaisakh in the 
        Sikh calendar, which typically falls on April 14;
Whereas Vaisakhi is a special occasion in which Sikhs remember the founding in 
        1699 of the Order of Khalsa, a fellowship of devout saint-soldier Sikhs, 
        by the 10th Sikh Guru to fight tyranny and oppression, which played an 
        important role in shaping the religion's history and identity; and
Whereas it is altogether fitting and proper to celebrate the day of Vaisakhi 
        alongside Sikhs throughout the world and to honor the lasting 
        contributions made by the Sikh community to the United States: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives supports the 
designation of ``National Sikh Day'' to honor and celebrate the 
important role played by the Sikh community in strengthening and 
inspiring the people of the United States.
