Whereas Specialist (hereinafter, ``SPC'') Bishop E. Evans was born in Arlington, 
        Texas, raised by his grandmother, and attended Mansfield High School, 
        where he was a member of the Junior Reserve Officers' Training Corps;
Whereas SPC Evans enlisted in the Texas Army National Guard in 2019, and was 
        assigned to A Battery, 4-133 Field Artillery Regiment in New Braunfels, 
        Texas;
Whereas SPC Evans was deployed to Kuwait in support of Operation Spartan Shield 
        and Iraq in support of Special Operations Forces, before being assigned 
        to the southern land border of the United States;
Whereas, on Friday, April 22, 2022, SPC Evans was reported missing after 
        selflessly rescuing two migrants who appeared to be drowning while 
        attempting to cross the Rio Grande; and
Whereas, on Monday, April 25, 2022, following an extensive search, SPC Evans was 
        discovered deceased along the Rio Grande: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the House of Representatives acknowledges, with 
        profound sorrow, that, following an extensive search, 
        Specialist Bishop E. Evans was discovered, deceased, along the 
        Rio Grande, near Eagle Pass, Texas;
            (2) the House of Representatives honors the life and 
        service of SPC Evans;
            (3) the gallantry of SPC Evans resulted in the survival of 
        the two migrants;
            (4) the Clerk of the House of Representatives communicate 
        these resolutions to the Senate and transmit a copy thereof to 
        the family of the deceased; and
            (5) when the House of Representatives adjourns today, it 
        adjourn as a further mark of respect to the enduring memory of 
        the deceased.
