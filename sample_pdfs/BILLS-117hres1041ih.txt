Mr. Mast (for himself, Ms. Schakowsky, Mr. Gallagher, Mr. Langevin, and 
 Mr. Trone) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the designation of July 20, 2022, as ``Glioblastoma 
                            Awareness Day''.

Whereas approximately 13,460 new cases of glioblastoma will be diagnosed in the 
        United States in 2022;
Whereas glioblastoma is--

    (1) the most common malignant brain tumor, accounting for approximately 
\1/2\ of all primary malignant brain tumors; and

    (2) the most aggressive, complex, difficult to treat, and deadly type 
of brain tumor;

Whereas it is estimated that more than 10,000 individuals in the United States 
        will succumb to glioblastoma each year;
Whereas the 5-year survival rate for glioblastoma patients is only 6.8 percent, 
        and the median length of survival for glioblastoma patients is only 8 
        months;
Whereas glioblastoma is described as a disease that affects the ``essence of 
        self'', as the treatment and removal of glioblastoma presents 
        significant challenges due to the uniquely complex and fragile nature of 
        the brain, the primary organ in the human body that controls not only 
        cognitive ability, but also the actions of every organ and limb;
Whereas patients and caregivers play a critical role in furthering research for 
        glioblastoma;
Whereas, relative to other types of cancers, brain cancer patients pay the 
        second highest out-of-pocket costs for medical services in both the 
        initial and end-of life phases of care;
Whereas, although research advances may fuel the development of new treatments 
        for glioblastoma, challenging obstacles to accelerating progress toward 
        new treatments for glioblastoma remain, and there are no screening or 
        early detection methods;
Whereas, in 2021, the World Health Organization reclassified brain tumors and 
        made significant changes to the molecular characteristics of a 
        glioblastoma diagnosis, necessitating critical biomarker testing for 
        patients suspected of having a possible glioblastoma;
Whereas, although glioblastoma was first described in medical and scientific 
        literature in the 1920s, and despite its devastating prognosis, only 4 
        drugs and 1 medical device have been approved by the Food and Drug 
        Administration to treat glioblastoma since the 1920s, and the mortality 
        rates associated with glioblastoma have changed little during the past 
        30 years;
Whereas, in 2020, the National Cancer Institute established the Glioblastoma 
        Therapeutics Network (referred to in this preamble as ``GTN''), as part 
        of a national infrastructure to enhance and support the discovery and 
        development of glioblastoma therapies available for multi-institutional 
        GTN teams to drive therapeutic agents through pre-clinical studies and 
        early-phase clinical trials, which are necessary to rapidly evaluate 
        potential treatments to advance toward cures and improved quality of 
        life; and
Whereas there is a need for greater public awareness of glioblastoma, including 
        awareness of both--

    (1) the urgent unmet medical needs of glioblastoma patients; and

    (2) the opportunities for research of, and treatment advances for, 
glioblastoma: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Glioblastoma Awareness 
        Day'';
            (2) encourages increased public awareness of glioblastoma;
            (3) honors the individuals who have died from glioblastoma, 
        a devastating disease, or are currently living with it;
            (4) supports efforts to develop better treatments for 
        glioblastoma that will improve the long-term prognosis for, and 
        the quality of life of, individuals diagnosed with the disease;
            (5) recognizes the importance of molecular biomarker 
        testing to the diagnosis and treatment of glioblastoma;
            (6) expresses support for the individuals who are battling 
        brain tumors, as well as the families, friends, and caregivers 
        of those individuals;
            (7) urges a collaborative approach to brain tumor research 
        among governmental, private, and nonprofit organizations, which 
        is a promising means of advancing the understanding and 
        treatment of glioblastoma; and
            (8) encourages continued investments in glioblastoma 
        research and treatments, including through the Glioblastoma 
        Therapeutics Network and other existing brain tumor research 
        resources.
