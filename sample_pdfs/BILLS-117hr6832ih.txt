          purchasing supplies to combat the COVID-19 pandemic.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

        President''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following:
    ``(e) Exception for State Contracts Relating to COVID-19 
Pandemic.--The President may not exercise the authority provided by 
subsection (a) on or after the date of the enactment of this subsection 
to prioritize the performance of contracts or orders of the Federal 
Government relating to the purchase of supplies to combat the COVID-19 
pandemic over the performance of contracts or orders of the government 
of a State or territory or possession of the United States relating to 
the purchase of such supplies.''.
    (b) Treatment Under Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.--Section 
564(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360bbb-
3(j)) is amended by adding at the end the following:
            ``(5) Nothing in this section or any other provision of law 
        shall be construed to authorize the Secretary to ration a drug 
        authorized for use under this section, limit or restrict access 
        to such a drug, or otherwise control the quantity of such a 
        drug made available for or distributed to any State or 
        territory, including by imposing any limitation on distribution 
        of such a drug to governmental entities, such as requiring a 
        State- and territorial-coordinated distribution system or 
        similar distribution system.''.

        to combat the COVID-19 pandemic that the State, territory, or 
        possession was unable to purchase before the date of the 
        enactment of this Act because of the invocation by the 
        President of the authority to prioritize contracts and orders 
        under section 101 of the Defense Production Act of 1950 (50 
        U.S.C. 4511).
