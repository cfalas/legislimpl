                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating the week of April 16 through April 24, 2022, as ``National 
                              Park Week''.

Whereas, on March 1, 1872, Congress established Yellowstone National Park as the 
        first national park for the enjoyment of the people of the United 
        States;
Whereas, on August 25, 1916, Congress established the National Park Service with 
        the mission to preserve unimpaired the natural and cultural resources 
        and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and 
        inspiration of current and future generations;
Whereas, on March 1, 2022, Yellowstone National Park was the first national park 
        within the National Park System to celebrate its sesquicentennial;
Whereas the National Park Service continues to protect and manage the majestic 
        landscapes, hallowed battlefields, and iconic cultural and historical 
        sites of the United States;
Whereas the units of the National Park System can be found in every State and 
        many territories of the United States and many of those units embody the 
        rich natural and cultural heritage of the United States, reflect a 
        unique national story through people and places, and offer countless 
        opportunities for recreation, volunteerism, cultural exchange, 
        education, civic engagement, and exploration;
Whereas visits and visitors to the national parks of the United States are 
        important economic drivers, responsible for contributing $28,600,000,000 
        in spending to the national economy in 2020;
Whereas the dedicated employees of the National Park Service carry out their 
        mission to protect the units of the National Park System so that the 
        vibrant culture, diverse wildlife, and priceless resources of these 
        unique places will endure for perpetuity; and
Whereas the people of the United States have inherited the remarkable legacy of 
        the National Park System and are entrusted with the preservation of the 
        National Park System throughout its second century: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the week of April 16 through April 24, 2022, 
        as ``National Park Week''; and
            (2) encourages the people of the United States and the 
        world to responsibly visit, experience, recreate in, and 
        support the treasured national parks of the United States.
