                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the value of the Older Americans Act Nutrition Program in 
    addressing hunger, malnutrition, food insecurity, and social or 
 geographic isolation and improving the health and quality of life for 
     millions of older individuals in the United States each year.

Whereas thousands of local nutrition programs supported by part C of title III 
        of the Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3030d-21 et seq.) 
        (referred to in this preamble as the ``OAA Nutrition Program''), both 
        congregate and home-delivered programs, provide a vital lifeline to 
        millions of individuals 60 years of age or older in communities across 
        the United States who may be homebound and socially or geographically 
        isolated, and struggling with hunger, food insecurity, or malnutrition;
Whereas local nutrition programs supported by the OAA Nutrition Program provide 
        nutritious meals, socialization, friendly visits, and wellness and 
        safety checks through volunteers and staff to individuals who may suffer 
        from long-term chronic conditions, as well as to those who live in the 
        community and have the greatest social or economic need;
Whereas the official purposes of the OAA Nutrition Program are to reduce hunger, 
        food insecurity, and malnutrition, to promote socialization of older 
        individuals, and to promote the health and well-being of older 
        individuals by assisting such individuals in gaining access to nutrition 
        and other disease prevention and health promotion services in order to 
        delay the onset of adverse health conditions resulting from poor 
        nutritional health or sedentary behavior;
Whereas the OAA Nutrition Program saves significant taxpayer dollars and reduces 
        health care expenditures, often paid through Medicare or Medicaid, by 
        helping to reduce falls, avoid unnecessary trips, admissions, and 
        readmissions to the hospital, expedite recovery from illness, and enable 
        older individuals to live independently for longer;
Whereas local nutrition programs supported by the OAA Nutrition Program are 
        proven, valuable, and effective public-private partnerships that benefit 
        from non-Federal private, corporate, and individual funding and 
        donations to operate their services efficiently and effectively;
Whereas the population of individuals in the United States who are 60 years of 
        age or older is rapidly growing and projected to increase dramatically 
        each year over the next several decades;
Whereas, on March 22, 1972, President Richard Nixon signed into law Public Law 
        92-258, which amended the Older Americans Act of 1965 and established a 
        national nutrition program for individuals 60 years of age or older; and
Whereas this 50th anniversary of the OAA Nutrition Program provides an 
        opportunity to celebrate and honor community-based organizations that 
        deliver vital and critical services: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes and values the important work of local 
        nutrition programs supported by part C of title III of the 
        Older Americans Act of 1965 (42 U.S.C. 3030d-21 et seq.) 
        (referred to in this resolution as the ``OAA Nutrition 
        Program'') nationwide in giving voice to and addressing senior 
        hunger, malnutrition, and isolation, and improving the quality 
        of life of millions of older individuals in the United States 
        each year;
            (2) recognizes and values the important role that local 
        nutrition programs supported by the OAA Nutrition Program and 
        national organizations play in increasing awareness of the 
        growing unmet need for these programs and in raising additional 
        non-Federal funds and soliciting volunteers to support and 
        assist these programs' important missions;
            (3) recognizes and values volunteers as the backbone of the 
        OAA Nutrition Program, noting that they deliver nutritious 
        meals to older individuals who are at significant risk of 
        hunger, malnutrition, and isolation, and provide caring concern 
        and attention to the welfare of program participants; and
            (4) encourages members of Congress to support their local 
        nutrition programs supported by the OAA Nutrition Program by 
        participating in 50th anniversary events, delivering meals to 
        homebound older individuals or serving them in a congregate 
        setting with a program in their district or State, and working 
        to ensure sustained Federal funding for the OAA Nutrition 
        Program.
