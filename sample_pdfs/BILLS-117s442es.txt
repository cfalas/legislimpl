To amend title 40, United States Code, to require the Administrator of 
  General Services to procure the most life-cycle cost effective and 
    energy efficient lighting products and to issue guidance on the 
efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of those products, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Bulb Replacement Improving 
Government with High-efficiency Technology Act'' or the ``BRIGHT Act''.

SEC. 2. GUIDANCE.

    Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Administrator of General Services shall--
            (1) issue guidance to Federal agencies for the procurement 
        and use of the most life-cycle cost effective and energy 
        efficient lighting systems (as determined in accordance with 
        section 3313 of title 40, United States Code) to increase the 
        efficiency, effectiveness, and economy of the Federal

        State, local, and Tribal entities information on ways to 
        improve efficiency, effectiveness, and economy by procuring and 
        using the most life-cycle cost effective and energy efficient 
        lighting systems (as determined in accordance with section 3313 
        of title 40, United States Code).

SEC. 3. PROCUREMENT OF LIFE-CYCLE COST EFFECTIVE AND ENERGY EFFICIENT 
              LIGHTING SYSTEMS.

    (a) In General.--Section 3313 of title 40, United States Code, is 
amended--
            (1) by striking subsection (h);
            (2) by redesignating subsections (d) through (g) as

        that follows through the end of subsection (c) and inserting 
        the following:
``Sec. 3313. Procurement of life-cycle cost effective and energy 
              efficient lighting systems
    ``(a) Definitions.--In this section:
            ``(1) Administrator.--The term `Administrator' means the 
        Administrator of General Services.
            ``(2) Lighting system.--The term `lighting system' means 
        the elements required to maintain a desired light level, 
        including lamps, light fixtures, fixture distribution, sensors 
        and control technologies, interior design elements, and 
        daylighting sources.
    ``(b) Procurement.--
            ``(1) In general.--To the maximum extent practicable, the 
        Administrator shall--
                    ``(A) procure the most life-cycle cost effective 
                and energy efficient lighting systems; and
                    ``(B) ensure that procurements after the date of 
                enactment of the BRIGHT Act of lighting systems or the 
                individual components of lighting systems maximize 
                life-cycle cost effectiveness and energy efficiency.
            ``(2) Use.--Each public building constructed, altered, 
        acquired, or leased by the Administrator shall be equipped, to 
        the maximum extent practicable as determined by the 
        Administrator, with the most life-cycle cost effective and 
        energy efficient lighting systems for each application.
    ``(c) Maintenance of Public Buildings.--Each individual component 
of a lighting system, including a lamp or fixture, that is replaced by 
the Administrator in the normal course of maintenance of public 
buildings shall be replaced, to the maximum extent practicable, with

possible for the application.
    ``(d) Considerations.--
            ``(1) Contracting options.--In carrying out this section, 
        the Administrator shall consider appropriate contracting 
        options for the procurement of the most life-cycle cost 
        effective and energy efficient lighting systems.
            ``(2) Procurement and use.--In making a determination under 
        this section concerning the practicability of procuring and 
        installing the most life-cycle cost effective and energy 
        efficient lighting system, the Administrator shall consider--
                    ``(A) the compatibility of the lighting system with 
                existing equipment, including consideration of a cost 
                effective retrofit;
                    ``(B) whether procurement and use of the lighting 
                system could result in interference with productivity;
                    ``(C) the aesthetics relating to the use of the 
                lighting system; and

                determines to be appropriate.
    ``(e) Life-Cycle Cost Effective.--The Administrator shall use the 
procedures and methods established under section 544(a) of the National 
Energy Conservation Policy Act (42 U.S.C. 8254(a)) in determining 
whether a lighting system is life-cycle cost effective.'';
            (4) in subsection (f) (as so redesignated)--
                    (A) in the matter preceding paragraph (1), by 
                striking ``lighting fixture or bulb'' and inserting 
                ``lighting system'';

                bulb is'' and inserting ``the lighting system or the 
                individual components of the lighting system are''; and
                    (C) in paragraph (3), by striking ``fixture or 
                bulb'' and inserting ``lighting system'';
            (5) in subsection (g) (as so redesignated), by inserting 
        ``procurement and'' before ``use in public buildings''; and
