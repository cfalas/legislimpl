                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the designation of April 2022 as the ``Month of the Military 
                                Child''.

Whereas thousands of brave Americans have demonstrated their courage and 
        commitment to freedom by serving the Armed Forces of the United States 
        of America in active-duty posts in Afghanistan, Iraq, and around the 
        world;
Whereas there are more than 1,600,000 children connected to the military across 
        the United States;
Whereas it is only fitting that we take time to recognize their contributions, 
        celebrate their spirit, and let our men and women in uniform know that 
        while they are taking care of us, we are taking care of their children 
        and youth;
Whereas the recognition of a ``Month of the Military Child'' will allow us to 
        pay tribute to military children and youth for their commitment, their 
        struggles, and their unconditional support of our troops because when 
        someone joins the military, it's a family commitment to our country, 
        military children are heroes in their own way; and
Whereas a monthlong salute to military children and youth will encourage our 
        country to provide direct support to military children and families: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports a ``Month of the Military Child''; and
            (2) urges all citizens, business, and government leaders to 
        observe the month with appropriate ceremonies and activities 
        that honor, support, and show appreciation for military 
        children.
