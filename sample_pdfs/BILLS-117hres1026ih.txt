Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that any Member of

        to any State or local jurisdiction, abolishing or disbanding a 
        police department or significantly reducing the budget of a 
        police department should not be permitted to use any Federal 
        funds, including amounts in the Members' Representational 
        Allowance, to contract with a private entity for security 
        personnel support.
