shall deem any care or services received by the veteran during the 
period beginning at the time of such admission and ending at the time 
of discharge from the facility at which such care or services were 
furnished to be authorized under subparagraph (A) if the covered 
veteran (or an individual acting on behalf of the covered veteran) 
submits an application for such authorization by a deadline that the 
Secretary determines appropriate for purposes of this paragraph, except 
that such deadline may not be earlier than 72 hours following such 
discharge.''.
