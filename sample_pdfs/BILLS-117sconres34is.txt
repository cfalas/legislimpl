  Mr. Lee (for himself, Mr. Cassidy, Mr. Braun, Mr. Scott of Florida,

   Hoeven, Mrs. Blackburn, and Mr. Boozman) submitted the following

                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
To express the sense of Congress in opposition to the establishment of 
    a new Palestinian consulate or diplomatic mission in Jerusalem.

Whereas the United States recognizes sovereign nations' authority to designate 
        their own capitals;
Whereas Jerusalem has served as the diplomatic capital of Israel for decades and 
        has remained the cultural center of Israel and of the Jewish people for 
        millennia;
Whereas large, bipartisan supermajorities in the Senate and the House of 
        Representatives voted for the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 (Public Law 
        104-45), which states, as the policy of the United States--

    (1) ``Jerusalem should remain an undivided city'';

    (2) ``Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of 
Israel''; and

    (3) ``the United States Embassy in Israel should be established in 
Jerusalem'';

Whereas, in 2018, the Trump administration relocated the United States Embassy 
        in Israel to Jerusalem in accordance with the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 
        1995;
Whereas the Biden administration's plan to open a Palestinian consulate in 
        Jerusalem could be viewed as a challenge to--

    (1) Israel's sovereignty over Jerusalem; and

    (2) Jerusalem's status as an undivided city;

Whereas such plan has received bipartisan criticism among members of the 
        Government of the United States and the Government of Israel;
Whereas the United States Embassy in Jerusalem's Palestinian Affairs Unit 
        already manages, in a timely and effective manner, the proposed 
        responsibilities of the Biden administration's planned Palestinian 
        consulate in Jerusalem; and
Whereas the opening and maintenance of a new and unnecessary consulate in 
        Jerusalem would require a substantial expenditure of American taxpayer 
        funds: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), 
That it is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) Congress opposes the establishment of a new Palestinian 
        consulate in Jerusalem;
            (2) establishing such a consulate would violate the intent 
        of the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995;
            (3) any establishment of a new consulate or diplomatic 
        mission in Jerusalem should not move forward without 
        congressional approval through the passage of new legislation; 
        and
            (4) the presence of a United States diplomatic mission 
        devoted to a non-state actor in Israel's sovereign capital 
        would be an affront to the territorial integrity of a long-
        standing United States partner and ally.
