        scoping, public comment, and environmental analysis 
        requirements under the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et 
        seq.) and the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 
        U.S.C. 4321 et seq.).
    (b) Annual Lease Sales.--
            (1) In general.--In accordance with the Mineral Leasing Act

                available for oil and gas leasing under the Mineral 
                Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 181 et seq.) or any other

        resource management plan in effect for the State.
            (3) Replacement sales.--If, for any reason, a lease sale

        or circumvent any Federal energy mineral leasing processes 
        under this Act, or a related rulemaking process required by 
        subchapter II of chapter 5, and chapter 7, of title 5, United 
        States Code (commonly known as the `Administrative Procedure 
        Act'), without congressional approval.
            ``(2) Rebuttable presumption.--There shall be a rebuttable 
        presumption that any attempt by the President to pause, cancel, 
        delay, defer, or otherwise impede or circumvent any Federal 
        energy mineral leasing process, or a related rulemaking 
        process, described in paragraph (1), without congressional 
        approval, is considered unreasonable for purposes of paragraph 
        (1).''.
