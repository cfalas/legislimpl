                               RESOLUTION


 
 Honoring military children during the National Month of the Military 
                                 Child.

Whereas almost 2,600,000 individuals demonstrate courage and commitment to 
        freedom by serving in the reserves or active duty in the Armed Forces of 
        the United States;
Whereas 35.9 percent of active duty members of the Armed Forces have children;
Whereas approximately 2,000,000 military children have experienced a parental 
        deployment since September 11, 2001;
Whereas no one feels the effect of deployments more than the children of 
        deployed members of the Armed Forces;
Whereas approximately 2,300,000 children under the age of 18 live with a veteran 
        who is disabled;
Whereas more than 25,000 military children have experienced the death of a 
        military parent since September 11, 2001;
Whereas the daily struggles and personal sacrifices of children of members of 
        the Armed Forces are too often unnoticed;
Whereas countless children live with a parent who is a member of the Armed 
        Forces and who bears a visible or invisible wound of war;
Whereas the children of members of the Armed Forces are a source of pride and 
        honor to the people of the United States, and it is fitting that the 
        United States recognize the contributions and celebrate the spirit of 
        such children;
Whereas the National Month of the Military Child, observed in April of each 
        year, recognizes military children for their sacrifices and contributes 
        to demonstrating the unconditional support of the United States for 
        members of the Armed Forces;
Whereas, in addition to programs of the Department of Defense and the Department 
        of Veterans Affairs to support military families and military children, 
        various programs and campaigns have been established in the private and 
        nonprofit sectors to honor, support, and thank military children by 
        fostering awareness and appreciation for the sacrifices and the 
        challenges that these children face; and
Whereas a month-long salute to military children encourages support for the 
        organizations and campaigns established to provide direct support for 
        military children and families: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) joins the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of 
        Veterans Affairs in honoring the children of members of the 
        Armed Forces and recognizes that such children share in the 
        burden of protecting the United States; and
            (2) urges the people of the United States to join the 
        military community in observing the National Month of the 
        Military Child with appropriate ceremonies and activities that 
        honor, support, and thank military children.
