                               RESOLUTION


 
       Designating April 2022 as ``National Native Plant Month''.

Whereas native plants are indigenous species that have evolved and occur 
        naturally in a particular region, ecosystem, and habitat;
Whereas there are more than 17,000 native plant species in the United States, 
        which include trees, shrubs, vines, grasses, and wildflowers;
Whereas native plants help prevent flooding, drought, and erosion and can help 
        restore damaged ecosystems;
Whereas native plants provide shelter as well as nectar, pollen, and seeds that 
        serve as food for native butterflies, insects, birds, and other wildlife 
        in ways that non-native plants cannot;
Whereas more than 200 of the native plant species in the United States are 
        estimated to have been lost since the early 19th century;
Whereas habitat loss and degradation, extreme weather events, and invasive 
        species have contributed to the decline of native plants in the United 
        States; and
Whereas native plants are essential components of resilient ecosystems and our 
        natural heritage: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 2022 as ``National Native Plant 
        Month''; and
            (2) recognizes the benefits of native plants to the 
        environment and economy of the United States.
