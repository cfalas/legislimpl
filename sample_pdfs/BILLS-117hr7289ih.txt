                                 A BILL


 
To provide for the National Academies to study and report on a Federal 
  research agenda to advance the understanding of PFAS, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Federal PFAS Research Evaluation 
Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) 
        are a group of man-made chemicals that have been used in a wide 
        range of products since the 1940s including firefighting foam, 
        carpeting, packaging, and cookware. There are more than 5,000 
        types of registered PFAS compounds. This chemical class is not 
        currently regulated at the Federal level.
            (2) PFAS have been detected in air, water, soil, food, 
        biosolids, and more. They accumulate and remain in the body for 
        a long time, and can lead to serious health effects including 
        cancer, low infant birthweight, liver and kidney issues, 
        reproductive and developmental problems, and more.
            (3) There remains much unknown about PFAS toxicity, human 
        and environmental health effects, exposure pathways, as well as 
        effective removal, treatment, and destruction methods, and safe 
        alternatives to PFAS.
            (4) There is currently no cohesive, interagency effort to 
        address PFAS, and no Federal agency is focused on a 
        multidisciplinary, cross-sector approach. Rather, there are 
        fragmented efforts at various agencies that have failed to 
        address the full scope of challenges presented by PFAS.
            (5) Regulatory action and cleanup depend on scientific 
        analysis of toxicity data, decision making on how best to deal 
        with the thousands of PFAS, and understanding the significance 
        of the many exposure pathways that exist. A consensus study by 
        the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 
        would help inform decisions by Federal and State Governments, 
        industry, and other stakeholders on how to best address PFAS.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL ACADEMIES REPORTS.

    (a) Research Assessments of PFAS Exposure and Toxicity.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date of
