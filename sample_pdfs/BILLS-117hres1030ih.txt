                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for the designation of the week of September 18 
through September 24, 2022, as ``Gold Star Families Remembrance Week''.

Whereas the term ``Gold Star family'' refers to the immediate family of a member 
        of the Armed Forces who, while serving, dies as a result of conflict;
Whereas the last Sunday in September--

    (1) is designated as ``Gold Star Mother's Day'' under section 111 of 
title 36, United States Code; and

    (2) was first designated as ``Gold Star Mother's Day'' under the Joint 
Resolution entitled ``Joint Resolution designating the last Sunday in 
September as `Gold Star Mother's Day', and for other purposes'', approved 
June 23, 1936 (49 Stat. 1895);

Whereas the term ``next of kin'' means individuals standing in such relationship 
        to members of the Armed Forces described in section 1126(d)(1) of title 
        10, United States Code;
Whereas there is no date dedicated to families affected by the loss of a loved 
        one who died in service to the United States;
Whereas the members and veterans of the Armed Forces, through their service, 
        bear the burden of protecting the freedom of the people of the United 
        States;
Whereas a gold star lapel button is given to honor the next of kin for those who 
        gave the last full measure of devotion;
Whereas among the Gold Star families are those whose loved ones are missing in 
        action and are presumed dead;
Whereas the selfless example of the service of the members and veterans of the 
        Armed Forces, as well as the sacrifices made by the families of those 
        individuals, inspires all individuals in the United States to sacrifice 
        and work diligently for the good of the United States; and
Whereas the sacrifices of the families of the fallen members of the Armed Forces 
        and the families of veterans should never be forgotten: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of a ``Gold Star Families 
        Remembrance Week'';
            (2) honors and recognizes the sacrifices made by--
                    (A) the families of members of the Armed Forces who 
                made the ultimate sacrifice in order to defend freedom 
                and protect the United States during active 
                hostilities; and
                    (B) the families of veterans of the Armed Forces; 
                and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``Gold Star Families Remembrance Week'' by performing acts of 
        service and goodwill in their communities, and by celebrating 
        the lives of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice so that 
        others could continue to enjoy life, liberty, and the pursuit 
        of happiness.
