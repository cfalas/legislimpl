  To promote economic growth and recovery throughout the Great Lakes 
 region, to restore and to protect America's principal source of fresh 
water, which holds twenty percent of the world's freshwater, making it 
 the largest system in the world, to foster innovation and to advance 
world-class workforce, education, training, and adjustment institutions 
for better jobs in the Great Lakes region, to strengthen and to expand 
   the core U.S. manufacturing and industrial base, and the required 
energy systems to sustain and to power production, and to work with the 
 Federal Government and provinces of Canada on our mutual Great Lakes 
challenges including the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence Seaway, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Great Lakes Authority Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The 8 States that comprise the United States portion of 
        the Great Lakes watershed contain the core of America's 
        commercial and industrial base.
            (2) The Department of Homeland Security defines these 
        industries as ``America's Critical Manufacturing Sector''.
            (3) The total economy for the United States Great Lakes 
        region generated $3.1 trillion in gross domestic product while 
        employing 25.8 million people and supporting $1.3 trillion in 
        wages.
            (4) Maritime commerce supports more than 147,500 jobs in 
        the 8 Great Lakes States and generates annual binational 
        economic benefits of $35 billion in economic activity ($26 
        billion in the United States), $10.5 billion in personal income 
        and local consumption expenditures in the United States), and 
        $4.6 billion in Federal, State, and local tax revenue in the 
        United States.
            (5) The Great Lakes region's 5 Great Lakes--Erie, Huron, 
        Michigan, Ontario, and Superior--are the source of 21 percent 
        of the world's surface fresh water and 84 percent of North 
        America's fresh water, making it the largest freshwater system 
        in the world.
            (6) Since the early 1980s, the inequalities between the few 
        and the many, the coasts and the interior, and the developed 
        and underdeveloped regions of the United States have widened.
            (7) The United States has closed 91,000 factories and lost 
        5 million manufacturing jobs since NAFTA was enacted in 1993 
        and since China joined the World Trade Organization in 2000. 
        The 8-State Great Lakes region lost 1.5 million of those jobs--
        that is, 30 percent.
            (8) The losses of factories and jobs, in turn, have greatly 
        weakened the fiscal capacity of the Great Lakes region's State 
        and local governments. A measure of this fiscal crisis is found 
        in the high municipal indebtedness of the region's cities, as 
        well as debt burdens due to Federal Government mandates.
            (9) When workers' jobs are outsourced or eliminated by 
        increased foreign competition, entire communities feel the 
        impact. Communities throughout the Great Lakes, including 
        communities of color, have struggled to rebuild the economic 
        conditions that once supported thriving working and middle 
        class lives for their residents.
            (10) The loss of factories and jobs has hollowed out entire 
        communities, leading to the spread of blight, pollution and 
        vacant and abandoned properties that destabilize rural, 
        suburban and urban communities across the Great Lakes region.
            (11) The Great Lakes States have not kept pace with 
        innovation. Specifically, in 1990, 51,000 United States patents 
        were issued and in 2020 the United States Patent and Trademark 
        Office granted 188,000--an increase of 265 percent, but not a 
        single State in the Great Lakes region reached the national 
        average by 2020.
            (12) The Great Lakes region faces numerous ecological 
        threats, including invasive species, toxic algae, erosion, 
        development, waste plastics, and toxic pollutants, among other 
        sources.
            (13) Heavy power demands across the region require a 
        dependable baseload energy supply with a highly skilled 
        workforce. Today, the region has 17 nuclear reactors at 15 
        sites in operation. Nuclear power provides 15 percent of the 
        electricity for Ohio and Wisconsin, 23 percent for Minnesota, 
        29 percent for Michigan, 33 percent for New York, 41 percent 
        for Pennsylvania, and 53 percent for Illinois; however, 
        competitive pressures from massive, new natural gas supplies 
        have created financial pressures that can make nuclear power 
        less competitive and more expensive.
            (14) Building back better in the Great Lakes region is a 
        challenge that requires an empowered and well-financed Great 
        Lakes Authority.
            (15) The Great Lakes Authority can support sustained growth 
        and innovation through public and private sector initiatives 
        and collaboration with regional stakeholders.
