            ``(3) Interest based on pecuniary factors.--
                    ``(A) In general.--For purposes of paragraph (1), a 
                fiduciary of a plan shall be considered to act solely 
                in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries 
                of the plan with respect to a plan investment or 
                investment course of action only if the fiduciary's 
                action with respect to such investment is based only on 
                pecuniary factors. The fiduciary may not subordinate 
                the interests of the participants and beneficiaries in 
                their retirement income or financial benefits under the 
                plan to other objectives and may not sacrifice 
                investment return or take on additional investment risk 
                to promote non-pecuniary benefits or goals. The weight 
                given to any pecuniary factor by a fiduciary should 
                appropriately reflect a prudent assessment of the 
                impact of such factor on risk-return.
                    ``(B) Investment alternatives for participant-
                directed individual account plans.--In selecting 
                investment options for a pension plan described in 
                subsection (c)(1)(A), a fiduciary is not prohibited 
                from considering or including an investment option on 
                the basis that such investment option promotes non-
                pecuniary benefits or goals, provided that the 
                fiduciary--
                            ``(i) satisfies the requirements of 
                        paragraph (1) and subparagraph (A) in 
                        considering or including any such investment 
                        option; and
                            ``(ii) does not consider or include such 
                        investment option as a default investment (as 
                        defined in the regulations issued by the 
                        Secretary under subsection (c)(5)(A)), or a 
                        component thereof.
                    ``(C) Pecuniary factor defined.--For the purposes 
                of this paragraph, the term `pecuniary factor' means a 
                factor that a fiduciary prudently determines is 
                expected to have a material effect on the risk and 
                return of an investment based on appropriate investment 
                horizons consistent with the plan's investment 
                objectives and the funding policy established pursuant 
                to section 402(b)(1).''.
