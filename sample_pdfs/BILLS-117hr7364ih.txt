            (1) In general.--Notwithstanding section 1308 of the 
        National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 4015), a 
        policyholder under the National Flood Insurance Program may

        property of the policyholder, as in effect on April 1, 2020, 
        apply and remain in effect during the period beginning on the 
        date of enactment of this Act and ending on the date on which 
        the Administrator completes all of the actions described in 
        subsection (c), without regard to the chargeable premium rate 
        that is in effect for that property, as of the day before the 
        date of enactment of this Act.
            (2) Notification requirement.--The Administrator shall 
        provide each policyholder under the National Flood Insurance 
        Program a notification regarding the right of the policyholder 
        under paragraph (1).
            (3) Refund.--The Administrator shall provide for a refund 
        to each policyholder making the election pursuant to paragraph 
        (1) in the amount of any chargeable premiums paid in excess of 
        the chargeable premium rate for the property as in effect on 
        April 1, 2020, and attributable to coverage during the period 
        beginning on such date and ending upon the date that such 
        election takes effect.
    (c) Required Actions.--The actions of the Administrator described

        (referred to in this subsection as ``chargeable premium 
        rates'') under Risk Rating 2.0, or any substantially similar 
        methodology.
            (2) Creates an online database that is available to 
        policyholders under the National Flood Insurance Program that 
        provides each such policyholder with information regarding what 
        the chargeable premium rate for the applicable property of the 
        policyholder would be--
                    (A) under Risk Rating 2.0, or any substantially 
                similar methodology; and
                    (B) assuming that the limitation under section 
                1308(e) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 
                U.S.C. 4015(e)) were not in effect.
            (3) Completes and publishes a comprehensive assessment of 
        the economic, social, and environmental impacts of implementing 
        Risk Rating 2.0 (or any substantially similar methodology) 
        during the 20-year period beginning in the year in which the 
        assessment is made, which shall include an evaluation of the 
        effect that such implementation will have, during that 20-year 
        period, on--
                    (A) the affordability and availability of flood 
                insurance under the National Flood Insurance Program;
                    (B) property values;
                    (C) non-Federal Government revenues;
                    (D) the expected cost increases and exacerbation of 
                inequality for low- and moderate-income policy holders, 
                particularly year-over-year policy rate changes under 
                the 18 percent limitation under section 1308(e)(1) of 
                the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 
                4015(e)(1));

                nationwide programmatic environmental impact statement 
                (83 Fed. Reg. 24328), will impact climate resiliency of 
                policy holders and communities; and
                    (F) how specific premium savings can be accessed by 
                mitigation measures, including how home builders can 
                determine the offset of increased cost of construction 
                imposed by implementing such measures, the regional 
                development of community flood risk measures, and 
                updating building codes.
            (4) Supplements (and revises, as appropriate) the Record of 
        Decision for the final nationwide programmatic environmental 
        impact statement evaluating the environmental impacts of

        Risk Rating 2.0, or any substantially similar methodology.
            (5) Demonstrates that the data and methods used to 
        prescribe chargeable premium rates under Risk Rating 2.0, or 
        any substantially similar methodology, satisfy the requirements 
        under section 515 of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2001 
        (Public Law 106-554; 114 Stat. 2763A-153), including that, in 
        implementing that methodology, the Administrator ensures and

        information disseminated by the Administrator.

        include the development of a fair, transparent, and streamlined 
        process to manage--
                    (A) disputes over chargeable premium rates; and
                    (B) other factors with respect to the 
                implementation of that methodology.
