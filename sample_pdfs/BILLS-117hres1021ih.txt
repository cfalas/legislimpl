                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the commencement of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of 
  fasting and spiritual renewal, and commending Muslims in the United 
            States and throughout the world for their faith.

Whereas it is estimated that there are approximately 1,800,000,000 Muslims 
        worldwide and 3,500,000 Muslims in the United States;
Whereas Ramadan is the holy month of fasting and spiritual renewal for Muslims 
        worldwide, and is the 9th month of the Muslim calendar year;
Whereas the observance of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan commences at dusk on 
        April 2, 2022, and continues for one lunar month;
Whereas one of the purposes of fasting during the holy month of Ramadan is for 
        Muslims to gain a better understanding of the plight faced by those who 
        are less fortunate;
Whereas American Muslims contribute greatly to charitable organizations that 
        help people from all faiths in the United States and around the world by 
        providing food for the hungry, medical assistance, family services, 
        scholastic supplies, before and after school programs, refugee 
        resettlement, and relief efforts following natural disasters;
Whereas American Muslims have contributed greatly to the United States, serving 
        as medical professionals, teachers, first responders, journalists, 
        writers, artists, athletes, small business owners, professors, 
        activists, community leaders, and elected public officials across 
        government representing both major political parties;
Whereas the American Muslim community is among the most racially diverse faith 
        groups in the United States;
Whereas Thomas Jefferson was the first President to host an iftar, the meal 
        breaking fast during Ramadan, at the White House in 1805, and every 
        President since 1996 has hosted an iftar for members of the community 
        during their Presidencies;
Whereas the Department of State and United States Agency for International 
        Development have hosted iftars through the years for staff and members 
        of the diplomatic community;
Whereas the Department of Agriculture has hosted iftar dinners since 2008 to 
        recognize and welcome interfaith dialogue and collaboration with 
        individuals and organizations whose core values often overlap 
        significantly with the mission of the Department, including disaster 
        recovery, reducing food waste, ensuring access to nutritious food, and 
        fostering safe, prosperous, and thriving communities;
Whereas the Pentagon has held iftar dinners to celebrate Ramadan starting in 
        1999, recognizing American Muslims serving in all branches of the United 
        States military; and
Whereas over 4,500 Muslims serve on active duty, and over 2,300 Muslims serve as 
        selected reserve personnel in the United States Armed Forces: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) in order to demonstrate solidarity with and support for 
        members of the community of Islam in the United States and 
        throughout the world, the House of Representatives recognizes 
        the Islamic faith as one of the great religions of the world; 
        and
            (2) in observance of and out of respect for the 
        commencement of Ramadan, the Muslim holy month of fasting and 
        spiritual renewal, the House of Representatives acknowledges 
        the onset of Ramadan and expresses its deepest respect to 
        Muslims in the United States and throughout the world on this 
        significant occasion.
