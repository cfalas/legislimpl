 To extend the authority for the establishment of a commemorative work 
  to honor enslaved and free Black persons who served in the American 
                  Revolution, and for other purposes.


 


    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Liberty Memorial 
Preservation Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that the period preceding the 250th anniversary of 
the founding of the United States on July 4, 1776, offers the best 
conditions in ten generations to honor and preserve the contributions 
of enslaved and free Black soldiers and civilians to independence by 
the triumph of a permanent National Liberty Memorial representing deeds 
Congress on two previous occasions declared of ``preeminent historical 
and lasting significance to the nation''.

SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF AUTHORITY FOR ESTABLISHMENT OF COMMEMORATIVE WORK.

    Notwithstanding section 8903(e) of title 40, United States Code, 
the authority provided by section 2860 of the Military Construction 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013 (division B of Public Law 112-
239; 126 Stat. 2164; 40 U.S.C. 8903 note) shall continue to apply 
through September 30, 2027.
