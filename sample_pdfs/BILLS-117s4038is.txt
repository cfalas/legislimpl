    This Act may be cited as the ``Renewable Diesel and Sustainable 
Aviation Fuel Parity Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. RENEWABLE DIESEL AND SUSTAINABLE AVIATION FUEL PRODUCTION AND 
              IMPORTS.

    (a) Definition of Sustainable Aviation Fuel.--In this section, the 
term ``sustainable aviation fuel'' means liquid that--
            (1) meets the requirements of--
                    (A) ASTM International Standard D7566; or

                International Standard D1655, Annex A1;
            (2) is not derived from palm fatty acid distillates, palm 
        oil, natural gas, coal, or petroleum; and
            (3) compared to petroleum-based jet fuel, has at least a 50 
        percent reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions, as 
        measured in accordance with--
                    (A) section 211(o)(1)(H) of the Clean Air Act (42
