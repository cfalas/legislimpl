                                 AN ACT


 
           To establish an Alaska Salmon Research Task Force.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Alaska Salmon Research Task Force 
Act''.

SEC. 2. PURPOSES.

     The purposes of this Act are--
            (1) to ensure that Pacific salmon trends in Alaska 
        regarding productivity and abundance are characterized and that 
        research needs are identified;
            (2) to prioritize scientific research needs for Pacific 
        salmon in Alaska;
            (3) to address the increased variability or decline in 
        Pacific salmon returns in Alaska by creating a coordinated 
        salmon research strategy; and
            (4) to support collaboration and coordination for Pacific 
        salmon conservation efforts in Alaska.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) salmon are an essential part of Alaska's fisheries, 
        including subsistence, commercial, and recreational uses, and 
        there is an urgent need to better understand the freshwater and 
        marine biology and ecology of salmon, a migratory species that 
        crosses many borders, and for a coordinated salmon research 
        strategy to address salmon returns that are in decline or 
        experiencing increased variability;
            (2) salmon are an essential element for the well-being and 
        health of Alaskans; and
            (3) there is a unique relationship for people of Indigenous 
        heritage who rely on salmon for subsistence and traditional and 
        cultural practices.

SEC. 4. ALASKA SALMON RESEARCH TASK FORCE.

    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of enactment 
of this Act, the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the 
Governor of Alaska, shall convene an Alaska Salmon Research Task Force 
(referred to in this section as the ``Research Task Force'') to--
            (1) review existing Pacific salmon research;
            (2) identify applied research needed to better understand 
        the increased variability and declining salmon returns in some 
        regions of Alaska; and
            (3) support sustainable management of salmon in Alaska.
    (b) Composition and Appointment.--
            (1) In general.--The Research Task Force shall be composed
