                                 A BILL


 
 To repeal the Federal charter for the National Education Association.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``National Education Association 
Charter Repeal Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The National Education Association (referred to in this 
        section as the ``NEA'') was chartered in 1906 by an Act of 
        Congress for the purpose ``to elevate the character and advance 
        the interests of the profession of teaching; and to promote the 
        cause of education in the United States'' and remains the only 
        labor union that has a Federal charter.
            (2) By continuing to hold its Federal charter, the NEA is 
        basically receiving a seal of approval from and support of 
        their actions by Congress.
            (3) The NEA can no longer be considered a public service 
        worthy of its Federal charter as it has drifted substantially 
        from its core mission and become a massive political operation 
        dedicated to electing Democrats and imposing a radical 
        progressive agenda on America's schools.
            (4) In July 2019, NEA members held a conference and voted 
        against adding a business item to the organization that stated: 
        ``The National Education Association will re-dedicate itself to 
        the pursuit of increased student learning in every public 
        school in America by putting a renewed emphasis on quality 
        education. NEA will make student learning the priority of the 
        association.''.
            (5) In the same conference, members voted in support of the 
        right to an abortion, supporting illegal immigrant justice, and 
        expanding professional development for educators to help create 
        student Gender Sexuality Alliance clubs.
            (6) According to disclosures made to the Office of Labor-
        Management Standards, from September 2019 to August 2021 the 
        NEA spent over $116.7 million on political activities and 
        lobbying, and in the 2020 election cycle, 95.7 percent of 
        candidate campaign contributions by the NEA went to Democrat 
        candidates.
            (7) The NEA adopted measures in July 2021 to support 
        critical race theory, calling it ``reasonable and 
        appropriate'', and to spend $56,500 on researching and shaming 
        organizations fighting the inclusion of critical race theory in 
        schools.
            (8) The NEA and other teacher unions stood in the way of 
        reopening schools in 2020 and 2021 by threatening strikes, 
        donating to Democrat candidates that backed school closures, 
        and influencing CDC guidance process to make it harder for 
        schools to reopen.
            (9) In 2021, NEA Board Member Mollie Page Mumau wrote on 
        Facebook that shooting people ``hiding behind religious 
        exemptions'' to vaccine mandates ``would be quicker and 
        ultimately safer than putting me and my friends and family at 
        risk''.

SEC. 3. NATIONAL EDUCATION ASSOCIATION.

    Chapter 1511 of title 36, United States Code (which granted a 
Federal charter to the National Education Association), is repealed.
