SEC. 4. FUNDING FOR DEVELOPMENT OF SECURE RARE EARTH SUPPLY CHAINS.

    (a) Multilateral Rare Earth Security Fund.--
            (1) Establishment of fund.--The Secretary of the Treasury 
        may establish a trust fund, to be known as the ``Multilateral 
        Rare Earth Security Fund'' (in this section referred to as the

                State--
                            (i) to provide funding through the common 
                        funding mechanism described in subsection 
                        (b)(1) to support the development and adoption 
                        of secure rare earth supply chains; and

                        on and after the date on which the Secretary of 
                        State enters into an arrangement or agreement 
                        with the governments of countries that are 
                        partners of the United States, as determined by 
                        the Secretary of State, to participate in the 
                        common funding mechanism under subsection

                        control licensing policies with respect to 
                        exports of finished rare earth products 
                        substantively equivalent to the United States 
                        with respect to restrictions on such exports to 
                        the People's Republic of China.
    (b) Common Funding Mechanism for Development of Secure Rare Earth 
Supply Chains.--

        Secretary of Homeland Security, the Secretary of the Treasury, 
        the Secretary of Energy, and the Director of National 
        Intelligence, may establish a common funding mechanism, in 
        coordination with the governments of countries that are 
        partners of the United States, that uses amounts from the Fund 
        to support the development and adoption of secure rare earth 
        supply chains, including for--
                    (A) research and development collaborations among 
                countries participating in the mechanism; and
                    (B) supplementing bids by foreign entities that are 
                not foreign entities of concern to secure offtake 
                agreements with entities that mine rare earth elements.
            (2) Contributions from participating countries.--In 
        establishing and sustaining a common funding mechanism 
        described in paragraph (1), the Secretary of State shall seek 
        to leverage amounts from the Fund to secure contributions to 
        the mechanism from the governments of countries participating 
        in the mechanism, including with respect to cost sharing and 
        other cooperative measures leading to the development and 
        adoption of secure rare earth supply chains.
            (3) Commitments.--In creating and sustaining a common 
        funding mechanism described in paragraph (1), the Secretary of 
        State shall promote efforts among countries participating in 
        the mechanism--
                    (A) to establish transparency requirements for any 
                subsidies or other financial benefits (including 
                revenue foregone) provided to rare earth firms located 
                in or outside such countries;
                    (B) to establish processes similar to the process 
                of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United 
                States under section 721 of the Defense Production Act 
                of 1950 (50 U.S.C. 4565) for intervening to preempt 
                foreign entities of concern from investing in, 
                purchasing, or assuming control of entities, 
                intellectual property, and equipment that are created 
                by or benefit from investments by the mechanism;
                    (C) to establish consistent policies with respect 
                to countries that--
                            (i) are not participating in the mechanism; 
                        and
                            (ii) do not meet transparency requirements 
                        established under subparagraph (A);
                    (D) to promote harmonized treatment of finished 
                rare earth products and verification processes for raw 
                materials or products being exported to a country 
                considered a national security risk by the government 
                of a country participating in the mechanism;
                    (E) to establish consistent policies among the 
                governments of countries participating in the mechanism 
                and common policies among countries that are not 
                participating to address nonmarket economy countries as 
                the behavior of such countries pertains to rare earth 
                elements;
                    (F) to align policies with respect to supply chain 
                integrity and security, including with respect to 
                protection and enforcement of intellectual property 
                rights; and
                    (G) to promote harmonized foreign direct investment 
                screening measures and export control policies with 
                respect to rare earth elements to align with national, 
                multilateral, and plurilateral security priorities.
