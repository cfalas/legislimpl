                                 A BILL


 
To amend the Families First Coronavirus Response Act to extend certain 
      waivers related to child nutrition, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Nutrition for American 
Communities and Kids Act of 2022'' or the ``SNACK Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Supply chain disruptions have made it difficult for 
        schools to get sufficient meals and supplies needed to serve 
        lunches to students.
            (2) School food authorities are going the extra mile to 
        provide students with nutritious meals, given the ongoing 
        supply chain issues.
            (3) In a 2021 survey of school nutrition directors, 97 
        percent expressed concerns with continued pandemic supply chain 
        disruptions, with 65 percent citing this as a serious concern.
            (4) Eligible children should be spared the harmful 
        consequences of current supply chain shortages by receiving 
        school-based meals.
            (5) School food authorities should have the necessary 
        flexibilities to address supply chain shortages.
            (6) School food authorities should receive full meal 
        reimbursement for meals provided when impacted by supply chain 
        delays beyond their control.
            (7) School food authorities have achieved extraordinary 
        success in keeping children fed throughout the pandemic. They 
        should be recognized for this service and supported in ongoing 
        work.
            (8) Due to the uncertainty of supply chains and inflation, 
        school food authorities should have the ability to apply for 
        waivers retroactively, recognizing disruptions may occur as 
        late as the day of service.
            (9) Before the pandemic, summer meal sites were required to 
        serve meals at a defined location, also known as congregate 
        meals. Due to the pandemic, sites and schools were allowed to 
        serve non-congregate meals, meaning parents could pick up meals 
        or organizations could drop off multiple meals at a child's 
        home.
            (10) Non-congregate waivers for summer meals made it easier 
        for school food authorities to feed eligible kids during the 
        summer months. Allowing non-congregate waivers for the summer 
        of 2022 will give school food authorities the stability they 
        need to feed eligible kids for the remainder of the summer.

SEC. 3. EXTENSION OF WAIVERS.

    Section 2202(e) of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (42 
U.S.C. 1760 note) is amended to read as follows:
    ``(e) Sunsets.--
            ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and 
        (3), the authority of the Secretary to establish or grant a 
        waiver under this section shall expire on June 30, 2022: 
        Provided, That such waivers shall only apply to school year 
        2021-2022.
            ``(2) Non-congregate summer food service program waiver.--
        The authority of the Secretary to grant or extend a waiver 
        under this section with respect to congregate feeding under the 
        qualified program described in subsection (f)(1)(D), and any 
        waiver so granted or extended, shall expire on September 30, 
        2022.
            ``(3) Supply chain meal pattern waiver.--The authority of 
        the Secretary to grant or extend a waiver under subsection (c), 
        and any waiver so granted or extended, shall expire on June 30, 
        2024.''.
