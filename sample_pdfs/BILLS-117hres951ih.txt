                               RESOLUTION


 
 Recognizing the 100th anniversary of the American College of Surgeons 
Committee on Trauma and the importance of preventing injury and saving 
                more lives from injury around the globe.

Whereas traumatic injury is the most common cause of death for individuals aged 
        1-45 years and the cause of nearly 200,000 deaths per year in the United 
        States;
Whereas 45,000,000 Americans live more than one hour away from a Level I or 
        Level II trauma center;
Whereas trauma systems are designed to deliver optimal trauma care for injured 
        patients, informed by best evidence and accessible to all injured 
        patients, regardless of circumstance;
Whereas the Committee on Trauma was established by the American College of 
        Surgeons (ACS) in 1922 to develop and implement programs that support 
        injury prevention and ensure optimal patient outcomes across the 
        continuum of care;
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma works to improve the care of injured 
        patients through activities in trauma system evaluation, trauma center 
        verification, trauma quality improvement, and education;
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma endeavors to improve care for injured 
        patients by setting standards of care, measuring risk-adjusted patient 
        outcomes, promoting best practices, and driving performance improvement;
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma has focused continuously and collaboratively 
        through a public health approach to prevent injuries, with major 
        reductions in the risk of injury, particularly from motor vehicle 
        collisions;
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma created the Consultation/Verification 
        Program in 1987 to assist hospitals in the evaluation and improvement of 
        trauma care and provide objective, external review of institutional 
        capabilities and performance;
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma created the National Trauma Data Bank, the 
        largest aggregation of United States trauma registries ever assembled, 
        in 1989, to generate data sets for expanding knowledge in trauma through 
        research;
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma created the Trauma Systems Consultation 
        Program in 1996 to review State and regional trauma systems and provide 
        recommendations for system improvement and enhancement;
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma created the Trauma Quality Improvement 
        Program in 2008 to elevate the quality of care for trauma patients by 
        collecting data from trauma centers, providing feedback on performance 
        compared to national benchmarks, and identifying institutional 
        characteristics for optimal patient outcomes;
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma established the STOP THE BLEED campaign in 
        2015 to prepare the public to save lives by teaching people three quick 
        actions to control serious bleeding and save lives; and
Whereas the ACS Committee on Trauma is committed to developing a National Trauma 
        and Emergency Preparedness System that saves more lives from daily 
        injury and mass casualty events by connecting local, State, and regional 
        trauma systems and informing best practice through standards and 
        research: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes the 100th 
anniversary of the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma and 
its significant contributions to preventing injury and saving lives 
from injury in the United States and around the globe.
