                               RESOLUTION


 
Expressing the sense of the Senate on the necessity of maintaining the 
United Nations arms embargo on South Sudan until conditions for peace, 
              stability, democracy, and development exist.

    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) the signatories to the Revitalized Agreement on the 
        Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, 
        signed on September 12, 2018, have delayed implementation, 
        leading to continued conflict and instability in South Sudan;
            (2) despite years of fighting, 2 peace agreements, punitive 
        actions by the international community, and widespread 
        suffering among civilian populations, the leaders of South 
        Sudan have failed to build sustainable peace;
            (3) the United Nations arms embargo on South Sudan, most 
        recently extended by 1 year to May 31, 2022, through United 
        Nations Security Council Resolution 2577 (2021), is a necessary 
        act by the international community to stem the illicit transfer 
        and destabilizing accumulation and misuse of small arms and 
        light weapons in perpetuation of the conflict in South Sudan;
            (4) the United States should call on other member states of 
        the United Nations to redouble efforts to enforce the United 
        Nations arms embargo on South Sudan; and
            (5) the United States, through the United States Mission to 
        the United Nations, should use its voice and vote in the United 
        Nations Security Council in favor of maintaining the United 
        Nations arms embargo on South Sudan until--
                    (A) the Revitalized Agreement on the Resolution of 
                the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan is fully 
                implemented; or
                    (B) credible, fair, and transparent democratic 
                elections are held in South Sudan.
