                               RESOLUTION


 
   Condemning the Biden administration's plans for seeking to remove 
sanctions on the oppressive Maduro regime and negotiating with Iran in 
response to the crisis in Ukraine, and instead calling for Congress and 
    the administration to support the production of American energy.

Whereas the United States was a net energy exporter before President Biden took 
        office;
Whereas America's energy independence ended within 1 year of the Biden 
        Presidency;
Whereas President Biden's hostile policies toward American energy production 
        discouraged investment in domestic energy infrastructure and production;
Whereas President Biden issued Executive orders to revoke permitting for the 
        Keystone XL Pipeline and issued a moratorium on energy production on 
        Federal lands on day 1 of his Presidency;
Whereas President Biden supported the Russian oil industry by refusing to 
        sanction the Nord Stream 2 pipeline;
Whereas a lack of domestically produced energy forces the United States to rely 
        on imported oil;
Whereas because of the suspension of Russian oil imports after Russia's 
        unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, officials in the Biden administration 
        have met with Venezuelan and Iranian officials to negotiate oil imports 
        to replace banned Russian oil imports;
Whereas President Biden's Department of State acknowledges that the Governments 
        of Venezuela and Iran frequently violate the human rights of their 
        citizens with arbitrary arrests, use of torture, extrajudicial killings, 
        State-sanctioned murder of protestors, and the holding of prisoners of 
        conscience;
Whereas, on January 28, 2019, the Trump administration imposed sanctions that 
        prohibit the importation of Venezuelan oil in response to the Maduro 
        regime's subversion of democratically elected President of Venezuela, 
        Juan Guaido;
Whereas, instead of importing oil from another autocratic regime and enriching 
        human rights abusers, the oil that United States consumers need could be 
        produced domestically;
Whereas increasing oil and natural gas production in the United States will 
        significantly reduce energy costs for American households and reduce the 
        inflationary burden faced by American families; and
Whereas unleashing the full force of the patriotic and hard-working United 
        States energy producers to supply the needs of Europe and reduce their 
        reliance on Russian energy will significantly reduce the ability of 
        Russian war criminal Vladimir Putin to fund his genocidal attack against 
        the free people of the democratic Nation of Ukraine: Now, therefore, be 
        it
    Resolved, That--
            (1) the House of Representatives calls on the Biden 
        administration and its officials to maintain the sanctions on 
        the repressive regimes in Venezuela and Iran; and
            (2) it is the sense of the House of Representatives that--
                    (A) American energy independence should be achieved 
                again for the sake of United States national security 
                and the security of United States allies;
                    (B) President Biden should immediately rescind his 
                Executive orders that prohibit the approval of new 
                leases on Federal lands and waters; and
                    (C) President Biden should immediately take action 
                to reestablish American energy independence, including 
                by--
                            (i) authorizing the completion of the 
                        Keystone XL Pipeline;
                            (ii) streamlining the approval of new 
                        leases on Federal lands and waters;
                            (iii) addressing regulatory burdens on 
                        domestic energy production; and
                            (iv) increasing United States energy 
                        exports, particularly to European allies of the 
                        United States.
