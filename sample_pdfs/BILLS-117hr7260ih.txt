                including relating to deficiencies along the physical 
                border, aerial and maritime vulnerabilities, and the 
                presence of illegal tunneling;
                    (B) a substantive review of the Department of 
                Homeland Security's technology, tools, or other devices 
                used to combat the trafficking of drugs across the 
                southern border, with an emphasis on fentanyl and 
                related substances;
                    (C) a thorough outline of the Department's 
                technology, tools, or other devices used to combat

                    (D) a list of known physical barriers, 
                technologies, tools, and other devices that can be used

                operational control along the southern border;
                    (E) a projected per mile cost estimate for each

                Department of Homeland Security believes is necessary 
                to achieve and maintain situational awareness and 
                operational control for each linear mile of the 
                southern border;
                    (G) an explanation for why such physical barrier, 
                technology, tool, or other device was chosen to achieve 
                and maintain situational awareness and operational 
                control for each linear mile of the southern border, 
                including--
                            (i) the methodology used to determine which 
                        type of physical barrier, technology, tool, or 
                        other device was chosen for such linear mile;
                            (ii) an examination of existing manmade and 
                        natural barriers for each linear mile of the 
                        southern border; and
                            (iii) the information collected and
