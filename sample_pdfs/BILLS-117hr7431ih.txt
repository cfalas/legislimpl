SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Veterans are among the greatest assets of the United 
        States.
            (2) Veterans are highly skilled and trained individuals 
        whose mission is to protect their communities.
            (3) Studies show that community-focused growth and 
        engagement assists veterans with mental health and combat-
        related trauma.
            (4) SCUBA diving has been found to help improve mental, 
        physical, and emotional health and has been specifically linked 
        to improvement in the symptoms of post-traumatic stress 
        disorder.
