                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the significance of endometriosis as an unmet chronic 
    disease for women and designating March 2022 as ``Endometriosis 
                           Awareness Month''.

Whereas more than 6,500,000 women in the United States are living with 
        endometriosis;
Whereas endometriosis is a painful and debilitating chronic disease affecting--

    (1) approximately 190,000,000 women throughout the world;

    (2) an estimated 1 in 10 women of reproductive age in the United 
States; and

    (3) primarily women in their 30s and 40s, but can affect any woman who 
menstruates;

Whereas the cause of endometriosis is not known, but risk factors include--

    (1) having a mother, sister, or daughter with endometriosis;

    (2) menstrual cycles that started at an early age;

    (3) menstrual cycles that are short; and

    (4) periods that are heavy and last more than 7 days;

Whereas endometriosis occurs when tissue similar to that normally found in the 
        uterus begins to grow outside the uterus;
Whereas the only way currently available to be certain of an endometriosis 
        diagnosis is to have a surgical procedure known as a laparoscopy;
Whereas the primary symptoms of endometriosis include pain and infertility, and 
        many women with endometriosis live with debilitating, chronic pain;
Whereas symptoms of anxiety and depression are common among women with the 
        endometriosis, with reported rates as high as 75 to 90 percent;
Whereas, although endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological 
        disorders in the United States, there is a lack of awareness and 
        prioritization of endometriosis as an important health issue for women;
Whereas women can suffer for up to 10 years before being properly diagnosed;
Whereas approximately 75 percent of women with endometriosis experience a 
        misdiagnosis;
Whereas endometriosis is 1 of the 3 main causes of female infertility, and 
        between 30 and 50 percent of women with endometriosis experience 
        infertility;
Whereas health care providers must focus on managing the symptoms of 
        endometriosis, which may include in vitro fertilization (IVF), low-dose 
        oral contraceptives, intrauterine devices (IUDs), painkillers, including 
        nonsteriodal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and gonadotropin-
        releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist therapy;
Whereas endometriosis is associated with increased health care costs and poses a 
        substantial burden to patients in the health care system;
Whereas, in the United States, the estimated average direct health care cost 
        associated with endometriosis per patient is more than $13,000 per year;
Whereas 40 percent of women with endometriosis report impaired career growth due 
        to endometriosis, and approximately 50 percent of women with 
        endometriosis experience a decreased ability to work;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the average 
        number of ``bed days'' for patients with endometriosis was 18 days per 
        year;
Whereas women with endometriosis can lose 11 hours per workweek through lost 
        productivity;
Whereas the physical and psychological impact of endometriosis affects all 
        domains of life, including social life, relationships, and work;
Whereas medical societies and patient groups have expressed the need for greater 
        public attention and updated resources targeted to public education 
        about this unmet health need for women;
Whereas there is a need for more research and updated guidelines to treat 
        endometriosis;
Whereas there is an ongoing need for additional clinical research and treatment 
        options to manage this debilitating disease; and
Whereas there is no known cure for endometriosis: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 2022 as ``Endometriosis Awareness 
        Month'';
            (2) recognizes the importance of endometriosis as a health 
        issue for women that requires far greater attention, public 
        awareness, and education about the disease;
            (3) encourages the Secretary of Health and Human Services, 
        the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Veterans 
        Affairs--
                    (A) to provide information to women, patients, and 
                health care providers with respect to endometriosis, 
                including available screening tools and treatment 
                options, with a goal of improving the quality of life 
                and health outcomes of women affected by endometriosis;
                    (B) to conduct additional research on endometriosis 
                and possible clinical options; and
                    (C) to update information, tools, and studies 
                currently available with respect to helping women live 
                with endometriosis; and
            (4) respectfully requests that the Secretary of the Senate 
        transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to the Secretary 
        of Health and Human Services.
