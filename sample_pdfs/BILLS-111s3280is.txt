        pursuant to subsection (a).

        (A) is to provide the contractor for a chemical 
        demilitarization facility an incentive to accelerate the safe 
        elimination of the United States chemical weapons stockpile and 
        to reduce the total cost of the Chemical Demilitarization 
        Program by providing incentive payments for the early 
        completion of destruction operations and the closure of such 
        facility.

        this subsection shall permit the contractor for the chemical 
        demilitarization facility concerned the opportunity to earn 
        incentive payments for the completion of destruction operations 
        and facility closure activities within target incentive ranges 
        specified in such clause.

                completion of destruction operations within the target 
                incentive range specified in such clause, $110,000,000.

                target incentive range specified in such clause, 
                $55,000,000.

        shall specify the target incentive ranges of costs for 
        completion of destruction operations and facility closure 
        activities, respectively, as jointly agreed upon by the 
        contracting officer and the contractor concerned. An incentives 
        clause shall require a proportionate reduction in the maximum 
        incentive payment amounts in the event that the contractor 
        exceeds an agreed-upon target cost if such excess costs are the 
        responsibility of the contractor.
            ``(D) The amount of the incentive payment earned by a 
        contractor for a chemical demilitarization facility under an 
        incentives clause under this subsection shall be based upon a 
        determination by the Secretary on how early in the target 
        incentive range specified in such clause destruction operations 
        or facility closure activities, as the case may be, are 
        completed.
            ``(E) The provisions of any incentives clause under this 
        subsection shall be consistent with the obligation of the 
        Secretary of Defense under subsection (d)(1)(A), to provide for 
        maximum protection for the environment, the general public, and 
        the personnel who are involved in the destruction of the lethal 
        chemical agents and munitions.
            ``(F) In negotiating the inclusion of an incentives clause 
        in a contract under this subsection, the Secretary may include 
        in such clause such additional terms and conditions as the 
        Secretary considers appropriate.
            ``(3) Additional limitation on payments.--(A) No payment 
        may be made under an incentives clause under this subsection 
        unless the Secretary determines that the contractor concerned 
        has satisfactorily performed its duties under such incentives 
        clause.
            ``(B) An incentives clause under this subsection shall 
        specify that the obligation of the Government to make payment 
        under such incentives clause is subject to the availability of 
        appropriations for that purpose. Amounts appropriated for 
        Chemical Agents and Munitions Destruction, Defense, shall be 
        available for payments under incentives clauses under this 
        subsection.''.
