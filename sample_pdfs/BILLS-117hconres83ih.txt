        resolution, amendment, motion, amendment between the Houses, or

        provision making such a designation shall be stricken from the 
        measure and may not be offered as an amendment from the floor.

                    (A) Waiver.--Paragraph (1) may be waived or 
                suspended in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of

                equally divided between, and controlled by, the 
                appellant and the manager of the bill or joint 
                resolution, as the case may be. An affirmative vote of 
                five-eighths of the Members of the Senate, duly chosen 
                and sworn, shall be required to sustain an appeal of 
                the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised 
                under this subsection.
            (3) Definition of an emergency designation.--For purposes 
        of paragraph (1), a provision shall be considered an emergency 
        designation if it designates any item as an emergency 
        requirement pursuant to this subsection.
            (4) Form of the point of order.--A point of order under 
        paragraph (1) may be raised by a Senator as provided in section 
        313(e) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 
        644(e)).
            (5) Conference reports.--When the Senate is considering a 
        conference report on, or an amendment between the Houses in 
        relation to, a bill, upon a point of order being made by any 
        Senator pursuant to this section, and such point of order being 
        sustained, such material contained in such conference report 
        shall be stricken, and the Senate shall proceed to consider the 
        question of whether the Senate shall recede from its amendment 
        and concur with a further amendment, or concur in the House 
        amendment with a further amendment, as the case may be, which 
        further amendment shall consist of only that portion of the 
        conference report or House amendment, as the case may be, not 
        so stricken. Any such motion in the Senate shall be debatable. 
        In any case in which such point of order is sustained against a 
        conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such 
        conference report by operation of this subsection), no further 
        amendment shall be in order.
    (f) Criteria.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of this section, any 
        provision is an emergency requirement if the situation 
        addressed by such provision is--
                    (A) necessary, essential, or vital (not merely 
                useful or beneficial);
                    (B) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not 
                building up over time;
                    (C) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need 
                requiring immediate action;
                    (D) subject to paragraph (2), unforeseen, 
                unpredictable, and unanticipated; and
                    (E) not permanent, temporary in nature.
            (2) Unforeseen.--An emergency that is part of an aggregate

71 (115th Congress), the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal 
year 2018, shall no longer apply.

revenues to be less than, the amount set forth under any allocation, 
aggregate, or other level established under this resolution.
    (b) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (a) may be waived or suspended 
in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of five-eighths of the 
Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of five-eighths of 
the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to

the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 633(b)).
    (b) Waiver and Appeal.--Subsection (a) may be waived or suspended 
in the Senate only by an affirmative vote of five-eighths of the 
Members, duly chosen and sworn. An affirmative vote of five-eighths of 
the Members of the Senate, duly chosen and sworn, shall be required to 
sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised 
under subsection (a).

        House);
            (2) the term ``Director'' means the Director of the

            (1) the Comptroller General of the United States shall, to 
        the extent practicable--
                    (A) determine the extent to which the covered bill 
                or joint resolution creates a risk of a new duplicative 
                or overlapping feature and, if the risk so warrants, 
                identify--
                            (i) the name of the new Federal program,

SEC. 4006. BREAKDOWN OF COST ESTIMATES BY BUDGET FUNCTION.

    Any cost estimate prepared by the Congressional Budget Office shall 
specify the percentage of the estimated cost that is within each budget 
function.

SEC. 4007. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON TREATMENT OF REDUCTION OF 
              APPROPRIATIONS LEVELS TO ACHIEVE SAVINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) H. Con. Res. 448 (96th Congress), the concurrent 
        resolution on the budget for fiscal year 1981, gave authorizing 
        committees reconciliation instructions which amounted to 
        approximately two-thirds of the savings required under 
        reconciliation.
            (2) The language in H. Con. Res. 448 resulted in a debate 
        about how reconciling discretionary spending programs could be 
        in order given that authorizations of appropriations for 
        programs did not actually change spending and the programs 
        authorized would be funded through later annual appropriation. 
        The staff of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate and the 
        counsel to the Majority Leader advised that upon consultation 
        with the Parliamentarian, the original instructions on 
        discretionary spending would be out of order because of the 
        phrase, ``to modify programs''. This was seen as too broad and 
        programs could be modified without resulting in changes to 
        their future appropriations.
            (3) To rectify this violation, the Committee on the Budget 
        of the Senate reported S. Con. Res. 9 (97th Congress), revising 
        the congressional budget for the United States Government for 
        fiscal years 1981, 1982, and 1983, to include reconciliation, 
        which revised the language in the reconciliation instructions 
        to change entitlement law and ``to report changes in laws 
        within the jurisdiction of that committee sufficient to reduce 
        appropriations levels so as to achieve savings''.
            (4) This was understood to mean changes in authorization 
        language of discretionary programs would be permissible under 
        reconciliation procedures provided such changes in law would 
        have the result in affecting a change in later outlays derived 
        from future appropriations. Further it was understood that a 
        change in authorization language that caused a change in later 
        outlays was considered to be a change in outlays for the 
        purpose of reconciliation.
            (5) On April 2, 1981, the Senate voted 88 to 10 to approve 
        S. Con. Res. 9 with the modified reconciliation language.
    (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that 
committees reporting changes in laws within the jurisdiction of that 
committee sufficient to reduce appropriations levels so as to achieve 
savings shall be considered to be changes in outlays for the purpose of 
enforcing the prohibition on extraneous matters in reconciliation 
bills.

SEC. 4008. PROHIBITION ON PREEMPTIVE WAIVERS.

    In the Senate, it shall not be in order to move to waive or suspend 
a point of order under the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 
621 et seq.) or any concurrent resolution on the budget with respect to 
a bill, joint resolution, motion, amendment, amendment between the 
Houses, or conference report unless the point of order has been 
specifically raised by a Senator.

SEC. 4009. ADJUSTMENTS FOR LEGISLATION REDUCING APPROPRIATIONS.

    The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may 
revise the allocations in effect under section 302(a) of the 
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 633(a)) and the allocations 
of a committee or committees, aggregates, and other appropriate levels 
in this resolution for any bill or joint resolution considered pursuant 
to section 2001 containing the recommendations of one or more 
committees, or for one or more amendments to, a conference report on, 
or an amendment between the Houses in relation to such a bill or joint 
resolution, by the amounts necessary to accommodate the reduction in 
the amount of discretionary appropriations for a fiscal year caused by 
the measure.

SEC. 4010. ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT LEGISLATION NOT INCLUDED IN THE 
              BASELINE.

    The Chairman of the Committee on the Budget of the Senate may make 
adjustments to the levels and allocations in this resolution to reflect 
legislation enacted before the date on which this resolution is agreed 
to by Congress that is not incorporated in the baseline underlying the 
Congressional Budget Office's September 2020 update to the Budget and 
Economic Outlook: 2020 to 2030.

SEC. 4011. AUTHORITY.

301(b)(4) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 (2 U.S.C. 632(b)(4)).

SEC. 4012. EXERCISE OF RULEMAKING POWERS.

    Congress adopts the provisions of this title--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, 
        and as such they shall be considered as part of the rules of 
        the Senate and such rules shall supersede other rules only to 
        the extent that they are inconsistent with such other rules; 
        and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        the Senate to change those rules at any time, in the same 
        manner, and to the same extent as is the case of any other rule 
        of the Senate.
