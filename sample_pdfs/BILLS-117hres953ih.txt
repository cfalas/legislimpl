        Services acted swiftly to assess damage and account for the lives of all 
        civilians affected by these tornadoes; and
Whereas the American Red Cross, United Way, local community groups, and faith-
        based organizations assisted in providing food, water, and shelter to 
        those displaced as a result of these tornadoes: Therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives thanked the first 
responders of southwest Florida for their critical actions that ensured 
the safety of thousands of Floridians during the tornadoes of January 
16, 2022.
