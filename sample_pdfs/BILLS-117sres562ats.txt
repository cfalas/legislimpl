                               RESOLUTION


 
 Designating March 24, 2022, as ``National Women in Agriculture Day''.

Whereas the United States proudly recognizes agriculture as one of the most 
        impactful industries of the United States, and acknowledges the 
        countless women who help agriculture prosper both at home and abroad;
Whereas there are more than 1,200,000 female agricultural producers in the 
        United States, making up more than a third of the agricultural producers 
        in the United States;
Whereas, in 2017, farms operated by women in the United States sold 
        $148,000,000,000 in agricultural products, accounting for 38 percent of 
        the total agriculture sales in the United States for that year;
Whereas, in addition to leading farming operations, women working in agriculture 
        make a difference across the United States in various commodity and 
        industry fields, such as research and development, manufacturing, sales 
        and distribution, agricultural education, agribusiness and advocacy, 
        which extends benefits to individuals across the globe through the 
        international trade of the United States;
Whereas the United States recognizes that women are vital in fostering the next 
        generation of the agricultural workforce by promoting STEM and 
        agricultural education and entrepreneurial and community initiatives and 
        by serving as mentors for 4-H, FFA, the Cooperative Extension System, 
        and numerous postsecondary agricultural science educator programs;
Whereas March is National Women's History Month; and
Whereas female professionals, instructors, and leaders in the agricultural field 
        should be celebrated for their efforts during National Ag Week, which 
        takes place between March 21 and March 25, 2022: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates March 24, 2022, as ``National Women in 
        Agriculture Day'';
            (2) recognizes the important role of women in agriculture 
        as producers, educators, leaders, mentors, and more; and
            (3) encourages all citizens to--
                    (A) recognize women working in agriculture; and
                    (B) praise the significant positive impact those 
                women have on the food resources and the agricultural 
                workforce of the United States by encouraging and 
                empowering women to--
                            (i) enter the agricultural field, which is 
                        a high-demand field of work;
                            (ii) cultivate opportunities to lead; and
                            (iii) feed a hungry world.
