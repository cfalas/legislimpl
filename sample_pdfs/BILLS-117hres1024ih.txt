        teachers, and parents of the Red Clay School District;

        the support of his mother, Marie L. Hammond-Newton;
Whereas Dr. Newton graduated from Delaware State University with a bachelor's 
        degree in criminal justice and sociology, and became a youth 
        rehabilitative counselor at Ferris School, a detention center for 
        incarcerated youth;
Whereas Dr. Newton returned to Delaware State for his master's and his doctoral

        with them based on love and mutual admiration;

Whereas Dr. Newton was resilient, determined, and persevered against all odds;
