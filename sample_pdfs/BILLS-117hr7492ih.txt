        relating to sex education in elementary schools; or
            (2) punish a State, local educational agency, or elementary 
        school, including by withholding Federal funds or levying fines 
        under title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 (20 U.S.C. 
        1681 et seq.) or any other Federal law, for failure to
