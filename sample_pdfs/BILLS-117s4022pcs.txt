 To codify in statute the CDC title 42 expulsion order, which suspends 
 the right for certain aliens to enter the United States along United 
              States land borders, until February 1, 2025.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. EXTENSION AND CODIFICATION OF TITLE 42 EXPULSION ORDER 
              ISSUED ON OCTOBER 13, 2020.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
            (1) On March 20, 2020, the Director of the Centers for 
        Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), pursuant to sections 362 
        and 365 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 265 and 
        268), issued the Order Suspending Introduction of Certain 
        Persons from Countries Where a Communicable Disease Exists (85 
        Fed. Reg. 16567), which was extended on April 20, 2020, and 
        amended on May 19, 2020.
            (2) On October 13, 2020, the Director of the CDC, issued a 
        similar order (85 Fed. Reg. 65806), which continued to protect 
        the public health from an increase in the serious danger of the 
        introduction of COVID-19 into the United States through ports 
        of entry.
            (3) On April 1, 2022, the Director of the CDC announced 
        that the policy implemented through the orders referred to in 
        paragraphs (1) and (2), and commonly known as the title 42 
        expulsion policy, would be terminated beginning May 23, 2022.
    (b) Temporary Extension of Title 42 Expulsion Policy.--
Notwithstanding the Order Regarding the Right to Introduce Certain 
Persons From Countries Where a Quarantinable Communicable Disease 
Exists, issued by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention on April 1, 2022, the Secretary of Homeland Security shall 
ensure that the following policy remains in place until February 1, 
2025:
            (1) Any person not described in paragraph (2) who is 
        traveling through Canada or Mexico and would otherwise be 
        introduced into a congregate setting in a land or coastal port 
        of entry or U.S. Border Patrol station at or near the United 
        States border with Canada or with Mexico may not be placed in a 
        congregate setting in the United States or otherwise admitted 
        into the United States. It is anticipated that the vast 
        majority of such persons will be aliens who are seeking to 
        enter the United States at a port of entry who do not have 
        proper travel documents, aliens whose entry is otherwise 
        contrary to the immigration laws, and aliens who are 
        apprehended at or near the United States border while seeking 
        to unlawfully enter the United States.
            (2) A person described in this paragraph is--
                    (A) a United States citizen or lawful permanent 
                resident;
                    (B) a member of the United States Armed Forces, 
                including associated personnel, and the spouse and 
                children of such members; or
                    (C) a person from a foreign country who holds valid 
                travel documents and arrives at a designated port of 
                entry, including any person from a foreign country 
                participating in the visa waiver program who is not 
                subject to travel restrictions.
