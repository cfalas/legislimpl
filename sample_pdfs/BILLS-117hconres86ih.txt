                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the goals and ideals of GLSEN's 2022 Day of Silence in 
bringing attention to anti-lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, 
 non-binary, Two-Spirit, intersex, and questioning (LGBTQ+) bullying, 
 harassment, discrimination, and other forms of victimization faced by 
                        individuals in schools.

Whereas the National Day of Silence is a day in which students take a vow of 
        silence to bring attention to the anti-LGBTQ+ bullying, harassment, 
        discrimination, and other forms of victimization faced by individuals in 
        schools;
Whereas GLSEN is a national nonprofit organization working to create safe and 
        affirming learning environments in primary and secondary schools 
        nationwide, regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender 
        expression;
Whereas GLSEN designates one day of every April as the Day of Silence;
Whereas hundreds of thousands of students at thousands of schools have 
        participated in the National Day of Silence in past years;
Whereas GLSEN's 2019 National School Climate Survey illustrates the pervasive 
        harassment and victimization faced by LGBTQ+ middle and high school 
        students by documenting their experiences within the preceding academic 
        year;
Whereas nearly 69 percent of LGBTQ+ students reported being verbally harassed by 
        their peers at school because of their sexual orientation, and nearly 57 
        percent because of their gender expression;
Whereas nearly 26 percent of LGBTQ+ students reported being physically harassed 
        by their peers at school because of their sexual orientation, and nearly 
        22 percent because of their gender expression;
Whereas 11 percent of LGBTQ+ students reported being physically assaulted by 
        their peers at school because of their sexual orientation, and over 9 
        percent because of their gender expression;
Whereas nearly 45 percent of LGBTQ+ students reported being cyberbullied;
Whereas 17 percent of LGBTQ+ youth reported being taught negative 
        representations of LGBTQ+ people and history;
Whereas nearly 56 percent of Asian-American and Pacific Islander LGBTQ+ students 
        experienced harassment or assault related to their sexual orientation;
Whereas 82 percent of American Indian or Alaska Native LGBTQ+ (or Two-Spirit) 
        students experienced bullying based on their sexual orientation;
Whereas 60 percent of Latinx LGBTQ+ students experienced bullying based on their 
        gender expression;
Whereas nearly 59 percent of Black LGBTQ+ students experienced bullying based on 
        their sexual orientation;
Whereas nearly 37 percent of LGBTQ+ students reported being harassed at school 
        based on their actual or perceived disability status;
Whereas 59 percent of LGBTQ+ students reported that they felt unsafe in school 
        because of their sexual orientation, and nearly 33 percent reported 
        missing at least one entire school day in the preceding month because of 
        safety concerns;
Whereas transgender students were more likely than all other students to report 
        feeling unsafe at school because of their gender expression, and were 
        more likely to report missing school or changing schools because they 
        felt unsafe or uncomfortable;
Whereas more than 77 percent of transgender students experienced discrimination 
        at school;
Whereas student academic performance is affected such that LGBTQ+ students who 
        experienced high levels of victimization because of their sexual 
        orientation, gender identity, or gender expression report a lower grade 
        point average than those of LGBTQ+ students who experienced low levels 
        of such victimization;
Whereas the presence of four supports--supportive educators, peer networks of 
        support, comprehensive school and district policies, and curriculum that 
        includes positive representations of LGBTQ+ people and history--
        contributed to a range of positive indicators including fewer reports of 
        missing school, fewer reports of feeling unsafe, greater academic 
        achievement, higher educational aspirations, and a greater sense of 
        school belonging;
Whereas a growing number of States, cities, and local educational agencies are 
        adopting laws and policies to prohibit bullying, harassment, and 
        discrimination against students on the basis of their sexual 
        orientation, gender identity, or gender expression; and
Whereas every child should be guaranteed an education free from bullying, 
        harassment, and discrimination regardless of their sexual orientation, 
        gender identity, or gender expression: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of the National Day of 
        Silence; and
            (2) encourages each State, city, and local educational 
        agency to adopt laws and policies to prohibit bullying, 
        harassment, and discrimination against students, teachers, and 
        other school staff regardless of their sexual orientation, 
        gender identity, or gender expression, so that the Nation's 
        schools are institutions where all individuals are able to 
        focus on learning.
