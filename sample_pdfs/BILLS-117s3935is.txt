 To require the Director of the Bureau of Justice Statistics to submit 
to Congress a report relating to individuals granted bail and pretrial

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Multiple jurisdictions across the United States--
                    (A) broke annual homicide records in 2021; and
                    (B) have reported individuals committing violent 
                felony offenses after being granted bail or pretrial 
                release.
            (2) The failure of felony defendants to appear for 
        mandatory court appearances and felony bail jumping has 
        increased in multiple jurisdictions across the United States.
            (3) The most recent report issued by the Bureau of Justice 
        Statistics relating to the pretrial release of felony 
        defendants in State courts is from 2007.
            (4) The National Pretrial Reporting Program of the Bureau 
        of Justice Statistics was created to collect information on 
        criminal justice processing of individuals charged with felony 
        offenses in State courts, with particular attention given to 
        pretrial release and detention.
            (5) In 2020, the National Pretrial Reporting Program of the 
        Bureau of Justice Statistics awarded a grant of $2,000,000 to 
        collect information relating to individuals charged with felony 
        offenses and released from criminal pretrial detention.
            (6) Neither the National Pretrial Reporting Program of the 
        Bureau of Justice Statistics nor the Bureau of Justice 
        Statistics has published any information relating to the 
        pretrial release of felony defendants in State courts since the 
        2020 grant award.
