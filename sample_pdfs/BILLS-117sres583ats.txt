                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the goals and ideals of National Safe Digging Month.

Whereas, each year, the underground utility infrastructure of the United States, 
        including pipelines, electric, gas, telecommunications, water, sewer, 
        and cable television lines, is jeopardized by unintentional damage 
        caused by those who fail to have underground utility lines located prior 
        to digging;
Whereas some utility lines are buried only a few inches underground, making the 
        lines easy to strike, even during shallow digging projects;
Whereas digging prior to having underground utility lines located often results 
        in unintended consequences, such as service interruption, environmental 
        damage, personal injury, and even death;
Whereas the month of April marks the beginning of the peak period during which 
        excavation projects are carried out around the United States;
Whereas, in 2002, Congress required the Department of Transportation and the 
        Federal Communications Commission to establish a 3-digit, nationwide, 
        toll-free number to be used by State ``One Call'' systems to provide 
        information on underground utility lines;
Whereas, in 2005, the Federal Communications Commission designated ``811'' as 
        the nationwide ``One Call'' number for homeowners and excavators to use 
        to obtain information on underground utility lines before conducting 
        excavation activities;
Whereas the 1,800 members of the Common Ground Alliance, States, ``One Call'' 
        centers, and other stakeholders who are dedicated to ensuring public 
        safety, environmental protection, and the integrity of services, promote 
        the national ``Call Before You Dig'' campaign to increase public 
        awareness about the importance of homeowners and excavators calling 811 
        to find out the location of underground utility lines before digging;
Whereas the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 
        (Public Law 112-90; 125 Stat. 1904) affirmed and expanded the ``One 
        Call'' program by eliminating exemptions given to local and State 
        government agencies and their contractors regarding notifying ``One 
        Call'' centers before digging;
Whereas, according to the Common Ground Alliance's 2020 Damage Information 
        Reporting Tool (DIRT) Report published in October 2021, there were an 
        estimated 468,000 instances of excavation-related damage to underground 
        facilities in the United States during 2020, and failing to contact 811 
        in advance of a digging project caused over 30 percent of these damages;
Whereas, in 2021, the Common Ground Alliance conducted a survey of active 
        diggers who have completed a project within the past 12 months and found 
        that 74 percent of the more than 1,800 respondents were aware of 811;
Whereas the Common Ground Alliance estimated that the societal costs of 
        excavation-related damage to buried utilities were $30,000,000,000 in 
        2019, including costs for facility repair, property damage, medical 
        bills, and costs to the surrounding businesses affected by the resulting 
        utility outages; and
Whereas the Common Ground Alliance has designated April as ``National Safe 
        Digging Month'' to increase awareness of safe digging practices across 
        the United States and to celebrate the anniversary of 811, the national 
        ``Call Before You Dig'' number: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Safe Digging 
        Month;
            (2) encourages all homeowners and excavators throughout the 
        United States to call 811 before digging; and
            (3) encourages all damage prevention stakeholders to help 
        educate homeowners and excavators throughout the United States 
        about the importance of calling 811 before digging.
