                               RESOLUTION


 
   Honoring the life and legacy of James Frederick ``Jimmy'' Hanley.

Whereas James Frederick ``Jimmy'' Hanley (referred to in this preamble as 
        ``Hanley'') was born on February 17, 1892, in Rensselaer, Indiana;
Whereas Hanley was educated at Champion College and the Chicago Musical College;
Whereas, in 1914, Hanley joined the United States Army and served during World 
        War I in the 82d Division;
Whereas, during Hanley's service in the Army, he wrote and produced an Army 
        musical show entitled ``Toot Sweet'';
Whereas Hanley became part of the Tin Pan Alley music scene in New York;
Whereas, as a vaudeville performer and writer, Hanley wrote the Broadway stage 
        scores for ``Jim Jam Jems'', ``Spice of 1922'', ``Big Boy'', ``Honeymoon 
        Lane'', ``Sidewalks of New York'', and dozens of other popular songs;
Whereas Hanley wrote such Broadway hits as ``Second Hand Rose'' in 1921, 
        performed by Fanny Brice in the Ziegfeld Follies of 1921, and ``Zing! 
        Went the Strings of My Heart'' in 1934, later popularized by Judy 
        Garland in 1938;
Whereas, in 1917, Hanley co-wrote ``(Back Home Again in) Indiana'' with Ballard 
        MacDonald, which was a hit and was based on the State song of Indiana, 
        ``On the Banks on the Wabash, Far Away'' by Paul Dresser; and
Whereas ``(Back Home Again in) Indiana'' has remained popular and has been 
        performed at every Indianapolis 500 since 1946: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) James Frederick ``Jimmy'' Hanley (referred to in this 
        resolution as ``Hanley'') was a talented Hoosier who provided 
        many musical compositions that were significant during the 
        1920s and 1930s;
            (2) Hanley's compositions, especially ``Indiana'', have 
        continued to be culturally significant in introducing Indiana 
        to individuals throughout the world who have never physically 
        visited the State;
            (3) the lyrics of ``Indiana'' provide vivid imagery of the 
        natural beauty of the State and the wonder of calling Indiana 
        home to both current Hoosiers and those who were raised in 
        Indiana and now live elsewhere; and
            (4) Hanley should be commemorated and remembered on the 
        130th anniversary of his birth for the cultural impact and 
        significance that his compositions and music continue to have 
        throughout the world.
