                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing gratitude on behalf of the people of the United States to 
 the journalists and news staff who are risking injury and death, are 
subject to grave threat, and have sacrificed their lives, to chronicle 
  and report on the ongoing war in Ukraine resulting from the Russian 
                         Federation's invasion.

Whereas Ukraine declared independence from the Soviet Union on August 24, 1991, 
        and that independence was reaffirmed in a popular referendum on December 
        1, 1991;
Whereas, on February 24, 2022, the Russian military invaded the sovereign 
        country of Ukraine under the direction of President of the Russian 
        Federation Vladimir Putin (referred to in this preamble as ``Putin''), 
        carrying out attacks on cities with ballistic missiles, heavy artillery, 
        and tanks;
Whereas Protocol I to the Geneva Conventions includes the Protection of Victims 
        of International Armed Conflicts, prohibiting attacks on civilian 
        persons and populations, and defines journalists and war correspondents 
        as civilians;
Whereas the Russian Federation was an original signatory to the Geneva 
        Conventions until Putin removed the Russian Federation from Protocol in 
        October 2019, demonstrating a clear disregard for innocent life;
Whereas, as of March 29, 2022, thousands of civilians, including children, are 
        recorded as having been killed during the Russian Federation's invasion 
        of Ukraine;
Whereas journalists and news staff are on the ground in Ukraine, reporting 
        freelance, reporting for global networks and media, and working on 
        documentary efforts to record the ongoing humanitarian crisis and war 
        caused by the Russian Federation's invasion of the sovereign country of 
        Ukraine;
Whereas many of the journalists and news staff covering the war in Ukraine are 
        United States citizens or working for United States news agencies;
Whereas shelling by Russian Federation forces has included the shelling of 
        humanitarian corridors, maternity hospitals, schools, and other 
        primarily civilian locations;
Whereas journalists and news staff are on the ground along Russian-targeted 
        humanitarian corridors and in major cities across Ukraine;
Whereas dozens of members of the free press have been murdered or injured by 
        Russian Federation forces as of March 29, 2022, with more casualties and 
        injuries likely;
Whereas, on February 26, 2022, Danish journalist Stefan Weichert was shot and 
        wounded while reporting near Okhtyrka, Ukraine;
Whereas, on February 26, 2022, Danish journalist Emil Filtenborg was shot and 
        wounded while reporting near Okhtyrka, Ukraine;

        Ramsay was shot and wounded when his car was ambushed by Russian 
        soldiers in Kyiv, Ukraine;

        was shot and wounded when his car was ambushed by Russian soldiers in 
        Kyiv, Ukraine;

        Yevhenii Sakun was killed when Russian Federation forces shelled a 
        television tower in Kyiv, Ukraine;
Whereas, on March 6, 2022, Swiss journalist Guillaume Briquet was wounded and 
        robbed by Russia soldiers who shot at his car on the road to Mykolaiv, 
        Ukraine;
Whereas, on March 13, 2022, United States documentarian and film director Brent 
        Renaud was shot in Irpin, Ukraine, and later died of his wounds;
Whereas, on March 13, 2022, United States journalist Juan Arredondo was shot and 
        wounded while reporting in Irpin, Ukraine;
Whereas, on March 15, 2022, Ukrainian Fox News journalist Oleksandra Sasha

        Zakrzewski was killed in Horenka, Ukraine, when his vehicle was struck 
        by incoming arms fire;
Whereas, on March 15, 2022, United States Fox News correspondent Benjamin Hall 
        was wounded when his vehicle was struck by incoming arms fire in 
        Horenka, Ukraine;
Whereas it is possible that additional Ukrainian and foreign press have been or 
        will be injured and killed so long as Russian Federation forces continue 
        their brutal attack on civilians;
Whereas all civilians, including journalists and news staff, should be spared 
        violence by military forces;
Whereas Putin and his cronies have demonstrated complete disregard for innocent 
        life, the sovereignty of Ukraine, the right to free speech, and the 
        rights and value of a free press;
Whereas Putin is engaged in a propaganda war, as well as a military war, and the 
        Russian Federation continues to push a false narrative about Russian 
        military presence in Ukraine;
Whereas the United States supports a free and fair press and rejects any and all 
        propagandist efforts by the Russian Federation to cover up and hide the 
        truth behind the Russian Federation's invasion;
Whereas journalists and news staff on the ground in Ukraine who are reporting 
        the truth to the world, including journalists and news staff from the 
        United States, are instrumental in combating false propaganda pushed by 
        Putin and his cronies; and
Whereas, despite the overwhelming threat and risk to their lives and the 
        sacrifices already made, journalists and news staff continue to report 
        bravely from Ukraine: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) declares its gratitude on behalf of the people of the 
        United States to the journalists and news staff who continue to 
        put themselves in harm's way to report on the humanitarian 
        crisis and ongoing war on the ground in Ukraine following the 
        Russian Federation's invasion;
            (2) remembers the journalists and news staff who have lost 
        their lives or have been severely injured reporting from 
        Ukraine and conveys the sympathies and appreciation of the 
        people of the United States to their families for their 
        sacrifice;
            (3) condemns President of the Russian Federation Vladimir 
        Putin, President of the Republic of Belarus Aleksander 
        Lukashenko, and their officials for authorizing and executing 
        attacks on innocent Ukrainian civilians, residential areas, and 
        humanitarian corridors, resulting in the loss of life of 
        civilians, including journalists and news staff; and
            (4) honors the contributions of journalists and news staff 
        reporting from the war in Ukraine as essential in the ongoing 
        struggle for the rights of a free press and free speech 
        internationally, pivotal in pushing back against false 
        propaganda by tyrants, and crucial to informing the people of 
        the United States and the world of the horrors being wrought 
        against the Ukrainian people.
