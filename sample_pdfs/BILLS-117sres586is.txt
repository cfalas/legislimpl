                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of the week of April 4 through 
         April 8, 2022, as National Assistant Principals Week.

Whereas the National Association of Secondary School Principals (referred to in 
        this preamble as ``NASSP''), the National Association of Elementary 
        School Principals, and the American Federation of School Administrators 
        have designated the week of April 4 through April 8, 2022, as ``National 
        Assistant Principals Week'';
Whereas an assistant principal, as a member of the school administration, 
        interacts with many sectors of the school community, including support 
        staff, instructional staff, students, and parents;
Whereas assistant principals are responsible for establishing a positive 
        learning environment and building strong relationships between school 
        and community;
Whereas assistant principals play a pivotal role in the instructional leadership 
        of their schools by supervising student instruction, mentoring teachers, 
        recognizing the achievements of staff, encouraging collaboration among 
        staff, ensuring the implementation of best practices, monitoring student 
        achievement and progress, facilitating and modeling data-driven decision 
        making to inform instruction, and guiding the direction of targeted 
        intervention and school improvement;
Whereas the day-to-day logistical operations of schools require assistant 
        principals to monitor and address facility needs, attendance, 
        transportation issues, and scheduling challenges, as well as to 
        supervise extra- and co-curricular events;
Whereas assistant principals are entrusted with maintaining an inviting, safe, 
        and orderly school environment that supports the growth and achievement 
        of each and every student by nurturing positive peer relationships, 
        recognizing student achievement, mediating conflicts, analyzing behavior 
        patterns, providing interventions, and, when necessary, taking 
        disciplinary actions;
Whereas, since its establishment in 2004, the NASSP National Assistant Principal 
        of the Year Program has recognized outstanding middle and high school 
        assistant principals who demonstrate success in leadership, curriculum, 
        and personalization; and
Whereas the week of April 4 through April 8, 2022, is an appropriate week to 
        designate as National Assistant Principals Week: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of National Assistant 
        Principals Week;
            (2) honors the contributions of assistant principals to the 
        success of students in the United States; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        National Assistant Principals Week with appropriate ceremonies 
        and activities that promote awareness of the role played by 
        assistant principals in school leadership and ensuring that 
        every child has access to a high-quality education.
