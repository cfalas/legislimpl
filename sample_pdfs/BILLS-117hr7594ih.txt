SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

SEC. 2. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to improve access for diverse-owned,

        firm selection processes of Federal institutional investors;
            (2) identifying common and potential barriers that limit 
        business opportunities for diverse-owned asset management firms 
        and developing strategies to remove these barriers; and
            (3) enabling both public and private retirement funds to 
        adopt broader and more inclusive selection processes to reduce 
        systemic risk and maximize returns, consistent with 
        administrators' fiduciary responsibilities.
