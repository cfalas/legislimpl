                               RESOLUTION


 
 Expressing support for the designation of the week of March 27, 2022, 
         through April 2, 2022, as ``National Cleaning Week''.

Whereas cleaning and disinfection are an investment in protecting human health 
        and safety;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stresses the importance 
        of routine cleaning and disinfecting to protect public health;
Whereas ISSA, the Worldwide Cleaning Industry Association, found that routine 
        cleaning and disinfection reduce the number of surfaces contaminated by 
        viruses by 62 percent and thereby significantly reduce the rate of 
        transmission of infectious diseases;
Whereas manufacturers and distributors have worked 24/7 to produce and deliver 
        critical cleaning and hygiene products throughout the COVID-19 pandemic; 
        and
Whereas essential frontline cleaning professionals work tirelessly to keep our 
        schools, hospitals, workplaces, and other spaces healthy and safe for us 
        all: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) recognizes the commitment and essential services 
        provided by the cleaning industry in maintaining clean and 
        sanitary conditions; and
            (2) supports the designation of ``National Cleaning Week'' 
        to continue to promote safe and clean environments at work, in 
        schools, and at home.
