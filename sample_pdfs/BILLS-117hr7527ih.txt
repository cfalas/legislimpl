                                 A BILL


 
To limit assistance to Jordan until the Government of Jordan recognizes 
the validity of the 1995 extradition treaty between the two countries, 
                        and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Recognition of the 1995 Jordan 
Extradition Treaty with the U.S. Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The Attorney General filed criminal charges against 
        Ahlam al Tamimi, a Jordanian national who participated in the 
        2001 suicide bombing of a Jerusalem pizza restaurant that 
        killed 15 people, including two Americans, in 2013.
            (2) Those charges were unsealed in early 2017.
            (3) Al Tamimi is on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's 
        Most Wanted Terrorist List.
            (4) The United States requested Ahlam Al Tamimi's 
        extradition in 2017, but Jordan's Court of Cassation ruled that 
        the extradition treaty was invalid.
            (5) In November 2019, the Secretary of State said that 
        ``the United States regards the extradition treaty as valid''.
            (6) The United States and Jordan signed a Memorandum of 
        Understanding on United States foreign assistance to Jordan, 
        the third such agreement between the United States and Jordan, 
        committing the United States to providing $1,275,000,000 per 
        year in bilateral foreign assistance over a five-year period, 
        for a total of $6,375,000,000 between fiscal years 2018 and 
        2022.
            (7) This latest memorandum of understanding represents a 
        27-percent increase in the United States commitment to Jordan 
        above the previous iteration and is the first five-year 
        memorandum with the kingdom. The previous two agreements had 
        each been in effect for three years.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to pursue justice for the victims of Ahlam al Tamimi; 
        and
            (2) to withhold foreign assistance from the Hashemite 
        Kingdom of Jordan until Jordan recognizes the Extradition 
        Treaty between the Government of the United States of America 
        and the Government of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, signed 
        at Washington on March 28, 1995, and entered into force on July 
        29, 1995.

SEC. 4. LIMITATION ON FUNDS.

    (a) In General.--Beginning on the date of the enactment of this 
Act, no funds authorized to be appropriated or otherwise made available 
for any program, project, or activity in Jordan may be obligated or 
expended unless the President determines that the Government of Jordan 
has recognized the validity of the Extradition Treaty between the 
Government of the United States of America and the Government of the 
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.
    (b) Withdrawal From Memorandum of Understanding.--The United States 
shall withdraw from the memorandum of understanding described in 
section 2(4) unless the President makes the determination described in 
subsection (a).
