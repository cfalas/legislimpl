  establish a program to accelerate the availability of commercially 
 produced high-assay, low-enriched uranium in the United States and to

                                 A BILL


 
 To amend the Energy Act of 2020 to require the Secretary of Energy to 
  establish a program to accelerate the availability of commercially 
 produced high-assay, low-enriched uranium in the United States and to 
   make high-assay, low-enriched uranium produced from Department of 
Energy inventories available for use in advanced nuclear reactors, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Fueling Our Nuclear Future Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the Department of Energy (referred to in this section 
        as the ``Department'') should prioritize activities to 
        establish a domestic high-assay, low-enriched uranium (referred 
        to in this section as ``HALEU'') enrichment capability, 
        consistent with subsection (c) of section 2001 of the Energy 
        Act of 2020 (42 U.S.C. 16281);
            (2) domestic HALEU enrichment will not be commercially 
        available at the scale needed in time to meet the needs of 
        advanced nuclear reactor demonstration projects; and
            (3) the Department needs to make available HALEU, produced 
        from inventories owned by the Department, for use by advanced 
        nuclear reactors consistent with subsection (d) of section 2001 
        of the Energy Act of 2020 (42 U.S.C. 16281), until such time as 
        commercial HALEU enrichment capability exists consistent with 
        that subsection.

SEC. 3. HALEU FOR ADVANCED NUCLEAR REACTORS.

    Section 2001 of the Energy Act of 2020 (42 U.S.C. 16281) is
