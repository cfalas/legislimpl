                               RESOLUTION


 
Supporting the goals and ideals of Mathematics and Statistics Awareness 
                                 Month.

Whereas mathematical and statistical research is ongoing, revealing new results 
        and applications every day in fields such as medicine, cybersecurity, 
        manufacturing, energy, biotechnology, and business;
Whereas mathematics and statistics are important drivers of innovation in our 
        technical world;
Whereas education in the mathematical and statistical sciences is foundational 
        and serves as a connecting fabric for all advances in science and 
        engineering;
Whereas science and engineering are becoming increasingly computational and 
        data-based, extending the need for quantitative, statistical, and 
        computational skills to all fields;
Whereas advances in mathematical and statistical sciences enable understanding 
        of complex systems and design of new technology, with implications for 
        societal challenges in health, defense, energy, transportation, and 
        other areas;
Whereas Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month began in 1986 as Mathematics 
        Awareness Week with a proclamation by President Ronald Reagan;
Whereas Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month is now held each year in 
        April with the goal to increase public understanding of and appreciation 
        for the mathematical and statistical sciences;
Whereas participation by United States women, African Americans, American 
        Indians or Alaska natives, and Hispanics or Latinos as percentages of 
        PhD recipients in the mathematical sciences have persistently been out 
        of step with national demographics, 28 percent, 3 percent, 0.5 percent, 
        and 3.5 percent, respectively, over the years 2005-2020 in comparison 
        with 51 percent, 13 percent, 1.3 percent, and 18.5 percent in the 
        general population for the same period;
Whereas the sponsors of Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month are working 
        together to transform the mathematical and statistical sciences 
        workforce through greater inclusion of women and underrepresented 
        minorities;
Whereas a more diverse mathematical sciences workforce would enhance the 
        mathematical sciences and also advance the national security and 
        economic interests of the country;
Whereas the sponsors of Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month are working 
        together to maintain the United States global preeminence in the 
        mathematics and statistics;
Whereas engaging young students, parents, and educators in hands-on activities 
        inspires future generations of talent in the mathematical and 
        statistical sciences;
Whereas Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month activities are organized 
        across the country by college and university departments, institutional 
        public information offices, student groups, and related associations and 
        interest groups and include a wide variety of workshops, competitions, 
        exhibits, festivals, lectures, and symposia; and
Whereas April is designated as Mathematics and Statistics Awareness Month, to 
        celebrate mathematics and statistics and the diverse researchers and 
        students in these fields who are contributing so much to furthering 
        discoveries and solving global problems: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Mathematics and 
        Statistics Awareness Month to increase the visibility of 
        mathematics and statistics as fields of study and to 
        communicate the myriad benefits of education in mathematics and 
        statistics;
            (2) recognizes that mathematics and statistics underpin all 
        of the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, and 
        mathematics), which are critical to the United States education 
        system and economic prosperity; and
            (3) celebrates the role that mathematics and statistics 
        play in the everyday lives of all Americans, including in our 
        technology, cybersecurity, news, games, literature, music, and 
        education.
