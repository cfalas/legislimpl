   Recognizing and celebrating the 200th anniversary of the birth of 
                         Frederick Law Olmsted.

Whereas April 26, 2022, marks the 200th anniversary of the birth of Frederick 
        Law Olmsted;
Whereas Olmsted was an author, journalist, public official, city planner, 
        landscape architect, and innovator who shaped the American landscape;
Whereas Olmsted influenced and designed beautiful and functional landscapes, 
        including Central Park in New York City and other major urban parks and 
        park systems, the United States Capitol Grounds, several State capitals, 
        estates, college campuses, and recreation areas;
Whereas Olmsted is remembered as the premier landscape architect in the United 
        States during the 19th century and is considered to be the founder of 
        landscape architecture in the United States;
Whereas Olmsted was one of the first individuals to promote the idea of national 
        parks in his 1865 Yosemite Report;
Whereas Olmsted believed that thoughtful landscape designs promote community, 
        advance democracy, provide recreational opportunities in urban 
        environments, nurture and invigorate public health, and encourage the 
        development of livable communities;
Whereas Olmsted's sons, associates, and successor firms carried out his 
        philosophy and designs well into the 20th century, including 
        establishing the American Society of Landscape Architects, leaving a 
        tremendous legacy of historic landscapes that continues to benefit the 
        people of the United States and visitors throughout the world;
Whereas Olmsted inspired the development of large parks and park systems for 
        public benefit in urban areas, creating a legacy of parks that are a 
        singular feature of the urban experience; and
Whereas Olmsted's landscape designs play a vital role in the enrichment of 
        States across the country and contribute to the quality of life in 
        hundreds of communities across the country: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives recognizes and 
celebrates the 200th anniversary of the birth of Frederick Law Olmsted.
