                               RESOLUTION


 
Commending the Government of the Republic of Lithuania for its resolve 
 in increasing ties with Taiwan and supporting its firm stance against 
                coercion by the Chinese Communist Party.

Whereas, on May 20, 2021, the parliament of Lithuania passed a resolution in 
        which it recognized the People's Republic of China's treatment of the 
        Uyghurs and members of Muslim and minority communities in Xinjiang 
        region as a genocide, called upon the United Nations to investigate the 
        People's Republic of China's internment camps for Uyghurs, and asked the 
        European Commission to review its relationship with the People's 
        Republic of China;
Whereas, on May 21, 2021, Lithuania withdrew from the 17+1 format that 
        facilitates collaboration between Central and Eastern European nations 
        and the People's Republic of China;
Whereas the 17+1 was designed by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) to both 
        create business and cultural exchange opportunities for the People's 
        Republic of China, and to divide European nations on sub-regional issues 
        regarding the People's Republic of China;
Whereas, on June 22, 2021, the Government of Lithuania announced its donation of 
        20,000 COVID-19 vaccines to Taiwan after the People's Republic of China 
        blocked Taiwan from participation in the world-wide COVAX vaccine 
        sharing scheme;
Whereas, on July 20, 2021, the Government of Lithuania announced the 
        establishment of exchange offices with Taiwan under the name of the 
        Taiwanese Representative Office;
Whereas the CCP has aggressively punished other organizations and nations for 
        using the name ``Taiwan'' to refer to the island, rather than referring 
        to it by the CCP preferred ``Chinese Taipei'', a practice by which the 
        CCP seeks to force other nations to conform to its view that Taiwan is a 
        part of China;
Whereas, in retaliation to the Government of Lithuania's announcement of the 
        Taiwanese Representative Office, the CCP implemented severe economic 
        restrictions on Lithuania;
Whereas, on August 10, 2021, the Government of the People's Republic of China 
        protested the announcement of the new Lithuanian office in Taiwan by 
        recalling its ambassador to Vilnius, and demanding that Lithuania remove 
        its ambassador from Beijing;
Whereas, on September 4, 2021, Lithuania's Ambassador to China, Diana 
        Mickeviciene, returned to Vilnius;
Whereas Lithuania's European neighbors and European Union (EU) leaders have 
        commended Lithuania's bravery and have expressed willingness to stand in 
        solidarity with Lithuania's decision, including by issuing a joint 
        letter from European Parliament members on September 3, 2021;
Whereas, on September 15, 2021, Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed the 
        United States commitment to Lithuania, stating, ``Lithuania and the 
        United States are very strong partners in NATO. We stand together for 
        collective defense and security. We stand against economic coercion, 
        including that being exerted by China.'';
Whereas, on September 21, 2021, the Ministry of National Defence in Lithuania 
        recommended that citizens not purchase phones manufactured in the 
        People's Republic of China and throw away their existing phones, after 
        evidence emerged that the devices have censorship technology built in;
Whereas, on September 22, 2021, the Government of Lithuania announced an 
        additional vaccine donation to Taiwan totaling 235,900 doses;
Whereas the People's Republic of China has engaged in economic coercion to 
        punish countries that do not do as the CCP wishes, including by banning 
        the import of Australian wine and agricultural products after the 
        Government of Australia supported launching an international 
        investigation into the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, closing South 
        Korean department stores and tourism after the Republic of Korea 
        deployed the United States Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile 
        battery, restricting imports from the Philippines after that nation 
        protested the People's Republic of China's assertive and unlawful 
        actions in Scarborough Shoal, and cutting the imports of Norwegian 
        salmon after Norway awarded a Chinese dissident with the Nobel Prize;
Whereas the CCP regularly uses its economic power to pressure Taiwan's 
        diplomatic allies to cut ties with the island and instead diplomatically 
        recognize the People's Republic of China, as it did most recently with 
        the Solomon Islands and Kiribati, leaving Taiwan with just 15 diplomatic 
        allies; and
Whereas the CCP has repeatedly and continuously barred Taiwan from meaningful 
        participation in key international organizations such as the World 
        Health Organization, International Civil Aviation Organization, and 
        other United Nations organizations and affiliated mechanisms in an 
        attempt to diplomatically isolate Taiwan: Now, therefore, be it

Whereas, on July 20, 2021, the Government of Lithuania announced the 
        establishment of exchange offices with Taiwan under the name of the 
        Taiwanese Representative Office, which formally opened on November 18, 
        2021;

        using the name ``Taiwan'' to refer to the island, rather than referring 
        to it by the CCP preferred ``Chinese Taipei'', a practice by which the

        part of China;
Whereas, in retaliation to the Government of Lithuania's announcement of the 
        Taiwanese Representative Office, the CCP implemented severe economic 
        restrictions on Lithuania, including the removal of Lithuania from the 
        People's Republic of China's customs registry and the rejection of 
        Lithuanian import applications;
Whereas, on August 10, 2021, the Government of the People's Republic of China 
        protested the announcement of the new Lithuanian office in Taiwan by 
        recalling its ambassador to Vilnius, and demanding that Lithuania remove

        solidarity with Lithuania against Chinese coercion, including by issuing 
        a joint letter from European Parliament members on September 3, 2021, as 
        well as in a statement from EU Minister for Foreign Affairs Josep 
        Borrell;

        actions in Scarborough Shoal, and cutting the imports of Norwegian 
        salmon after Norway awarded a Chinese dissident with the Nobel Prize;
Whereas the People's Republic of China has made efforts to coerce multinational 
        companies to suspend business in Lithuanian by threatening to exclude 
        them from the Chinese market;

        allies;
Whereas Taiwan announced the creation of a $200,000,000 investment fund to 
        increase bilateral trade and support critical industries in Lithuania, 
        and has made efforts to receive Lithuanian goods originally bound for 
        China that were blocked from delivery by the Government of the People's 
        Republic of China; and
Whereas the CCP has repeatedly and continuously barred Taiwan from meaningful

        partner; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) supports Taiwan in its struggle against CCP 
        malign influence, coercion, and aggression, which threatens not 
        only the Taiwanese people and countries in the Indo-Pacific,
