construed to preclude the Secretary of State from convening a follow-up 
public board of inquiry to investigate any security incident if the 
incident was of such magnitude or significance that an internal process 
is deemed insufficient to understand and investigate the incident. All 
materials gathered during the procedures provided under this title 
shall be provided to any related board of inquiry convened by the 
Secretary.''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Diplomatic Support and Security Act 
of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) A robust overseas diplomatic presence is part of an 
        effective foreign policy, particularly in volatile environments 
        where a flexible and timely diplomatic response can be decisive 
        in preventing and addressing conflict.
            (2) Diplomats routinely put themselves and their families 
        at great personal risk to serve their country overseas where 
        they face threats related to international terrorism, violent 
        conflict, and public health, among others.
            (3) The Department of State has a remarkable record of 
        protecting personnel while enabling an enormous amount of 
        global diplomatic activity, often in unsecure and remote places 
        and facing a variety of evolving risks and threats. With 
        support from Congress, the Department of State has revised 
        policy, improved physical security through retrofitting and 
        replacing old facilities, deployed additional security 
        personnel and armored vehicles, and greatly enhanced training 
        requirements and facilities, including the new Foreign Affairs 
        Security Training Center in Blackstone, Virginia.
            (4) Diplomatic missions rely on robust staffing and 
        ambitious external engagement to advance United States 
        interests as diverse as competing with China's malign influence 
        around the world, fighting terrorism and transnational 
        organized crime, preventing and addressing violent conflict and 
        humanitarian disasters, promoting United States businesses and 
        trade, protecting the rights of marginalized groups, addressing 
        climate change, and preventing pandemic disease.
            (5) However, efforts to protect personnel overseas have 
        often resulted in inhibiting diplomatic activity and limiting 
        engagement between embassy personnel and local governments and 
        populations.
            (6) Given that Congress currently provides annual 
        appropriations in excess of $1,900,000,000 for embassy 
        security, construction, and maintenance, the Department of 
        State should be able ensure a robust overseas presence without 
        inhibiting the ability of diplomats to--
                    (A) meet outside United States secured facilities 
                with foreign leaders to explain, defend, and advance 
                United States priorities;
                    (B) understand and report on foreign political, 
                social, and economic conditions through meeting and 
                interacting with community officials outside of United 
                States facilities;
                    (C) provide United States citizen services; and
                    (D) collaborate and, at times, compete with other 
                diplomatic missions, particularly those, such as the 
                People's Republic of China, that do not restrictions on 
                meeting locations.
            (7) Given these stakes, Congress has a responsibility to 
        empower, support, and hold the Department of State accountable 
        for implementing an aggressive strategy to ensure a robust 
        overseas presence that mitigates potential risks and adequately 
        considers the myriad direct and indirect consequences of a lack 
        of diplomatic presence.

SEC. 3. ENCOURAGING EXPEDITIONARY DIPLOMACY.

    (a) Purpose.--Subsection (b) of section 102 of the Diplomatic 
Security Act (22 U.S.C. 4801(b)) is amended--

        Secretary investigate accountability for United States 
        Government personnel with security-related responsibilities;'';
            (2) by redesignating paragraphs (4) and (5) as paragraphs 
        (5) and (6), respectively; and
            (3) by inserting after paragraph (3) the following new

        301(a)(1), shall begin when a United States mission reports a 
        Serious Security Incident at the mission. Such a report shall 
        include an initial report of the incident and shall be made 
        within three days of the incident, when feasible.
            ``(2) Investigation.--Not later than 10 days following a 
        report under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall direct the 
        Diplomatic Security Service to assemble an investigative team 
        to investigate the incident and independently establish what 
        occurred. The investigation shall cover--
                    ``(A) an assessment of what occurred, who 
                perpetrated or is suspected of having perpetrated the

                approved operations or movements outside the United 
                States mission, an assessment of whether proper 
                security briefings and procedures were in place and 
                weighing of risk of the operation or movement took 
                place; and

prepare a Report of Investigation at the conclusion of the 
investigation and submit the report to the SRC no later than 90 days 
after the occurrence of a Serious Security Incident. The report shall

        injuries, and damage resulting from the incident.
            ``(3) A review of security procedures and directives in 
        place at the time of the incident.
    ``(c) Confidentiality.--The investigative team shall adopt such 
procedures with respect to confidentiality as determined necessary, 
including procedures relating to the conduct of closed proceedings or 
the submission and use of evidence in camera, to ensure in particular 
the protection of classified information relating to national defense, 
foreign policy, or intelligence matters. The Director of National 
Intelligence shall establish the level of protection required for 
intelligence information and for information relating to intelligence 
personnel included in the report under subsection (b). The SRC shall 
determine the level of classification of the final report prepared 
under section 304(b), but shall incorporate the same confidentiality 
measures in such report to the maximum extent practicable.''.

security incident at a United States mission abroad, including an 
examination of the facts and circumstances surrounding any serious 
injuries, loss of life, or significant destruction of property 
resulting from the incident and shall make the following written 
findings:
            ``(1) Whether the incident was security related and 
        constituted a serious security incident.
            ``(2) If the incident involved a diplomatic compound, 
        motorcade, residence, or other mission facility, whether the 
        security systems, security countermeasures, and security 
        procedures operated as intended, and whether such systems 
        worked to materially mitigate the attack or were found to be 
        inadequate to mitigate the threat and attack.
            ``(3) If the incident involved an individual or group of 
        officers conducting an approved operation outside the mission, 
        a determination whether a valid process was followed in 
        evaluating the requested operation and weighing the risk of the 
        operation. Such determination shall not seek to assign 
        accountability for the incident unless the SRC determines that 
        an official breached their duty.
            ``(4) An assessment of the impact of intelligence and 
        information availability, and whether the mission was aware of 
        the general operating threat environment or any more specific 
        threat intelligence or information and took that into account 
        in ongoing and specific operations.
            ``(5) Such other facts and circumstances that may be 
        relevant to the appropriate security management of United 
        States missions abroad.
    ``(b) SRC Report.--Not later than 60 days after receiving the 
Report of Investigation prepared under section 303(b), the SRC shall 
submit a report to the Secretary of State including the findings under 
subsection (a) and any related recommendations. Not later than 90 days 
after receiving the report, the Secretary of State shall submit the 
report to the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the 
Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.
    ``(c) Personnel Recommendations.--If in the course of conducting an 
investigation under section 303, the investigative team finds 
reasonable cause to believe any individual described in section 
303(a)(2)(D) has breached the duty of that individual or finds lesser 
failures on the part of an individual in the performance of his or her 
duties related to the incident, it shall be reported to the SRC. If the 
SRC find reasonable cause to support the determination, it shall be 
reported to the Secretary for appropriate action.''.

board of inquiry to investigate any security incident if the incident 
was of such magnitude or significance that an internal process is 
deemed insufficient to understand and investigate the incident. All 
materials gathered during the procedures provided under this title 
shall be provided to any related board of inquiry convened by the 
Secretary.''.
