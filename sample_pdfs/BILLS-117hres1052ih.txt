                               RESOLUTION


 
    Supporting the goals and ideals of a National Move Over Law Day.

Whereas the House of Representatives wishes to recognize law enforcement, fire 
        and rescue, emergency medical services, tow truck operators, and 
        transportation workers as traffic incident management responders (as 
        such term is defined by the Traffic Incident Management Handbook of the 
        Federal Highway Administration);
Whereas, due to the increasingly high rate of distracted drivers on the roadway, 
        many traffic incident management responders lose their lives while 
        performing their duties each year;
Whereas, nationally in 2021, 65 traffic incident management responders were 
        killed due to roadside collisions;
Whereas every State has a ``move over'' law, which has correlated directly to a 
        safer environment along our Nation's roadsides for traffic incident 
        management responders and stranded citizens;
Whereas ``move over'' laws generally require motorists to move at least 1 lane 
        over when there is an emergency or rescue activity taking place on the 
        shoulder or side of the roadway, or, if unable to do so safely, to slow 
        down and pass the scene with caution;
Whereas a Government Accountability Office report (GAO-21-166) on Emergency 
        Responder Safety noted that State officials cite raising public 
        awareness as the most prevalent challenge to ``move over'' laws; and
Whereas providing traffic incident management responders an enhanced opportunity 
        to inform the motoring public about these laws is critical to the public 
        safety: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of a National Move Over 
        Law Day;
            (2) urges the national incident management organizations, 
        as well as State and regional incident management 
        organizations, to spread awareness and promote the existence 
        of, and adherence to, State ``move over'' laws; and
            (3) urges the national incident management organizations, 
        and similar State and regional incident management 
        organizations, to educate the public further on the dangers and 
        loss of life if the provisions and requirements of State ``move 
        over'' laws are not faithfully observed.
