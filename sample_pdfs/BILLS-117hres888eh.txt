H. Res. 888

                In the House of Representatives, U. S.,

                                                        March 17, 2022.
Whereas on January 30, 1972, 26 unarmed civilians were shot by British soldiers 
        during a protest that began peacefully in Derry, resulting in the death 
        of 14 individuals in a massacre now known as Bloody Sunday;
Whereas as a result of the soldiers' unjustifiable use of force, the individuals 
        known as John ``Jackie'' Duddy, Patrick ``Paddy'' Doherty, Bernard 
        ``Barney'' McGuigan, Hugh Gilmour, Kevin McElhinney, Michael Kelly, John 
        Young, William Nash, Michael McDaid, James Wray, Gerald Donaghy, Gerard 
        McKinney, William McKinney, and John Johnston tragically lost their 
        lives;
Whereas Bloody Sunday was one of the most significant and deadly injustices to 
        take place during the Troubles, and exacerbated the conflict in Northern 
        Ireland;
Whereas none of those shot by British Army soldiers posed a threat of causing 
        death or serious injury, or were doing anything else that could justify 
        their shooting;
Whereas the families of the victims of Bloody Sunday were denied for decades an 
        honest and comprehensive assessment of the events that took place on 
        Bloody Sunday;
Whereas in 1998, after campaigns from the families of those injured and killed 
        on Bloody Sunday, a second inquiry was established by the Government of 
        the United Kingdom;
Whereas this second Bloody Sunday Inquiry found that the shootings that took 
        place on Bloody Sunday were the result of wrongful actions taken by 
        British soldiers;
Whereas on June 15, 2010, then-Prime Minister David Cameron while addressing the 
        House of Commons apologized on behalf of the Government of the United 
        Kingdom saying that the events that took place on Bloody Sunday were 
        ``unjustified'', ``unjustifiable'', and ``wrong'';
Whereas despite these findings and acknowledgment made by the Government of the 
        United Kingdom, none of the individuals involved in the unlawful use of 
        force that led to the murder of 14 innocent civilians on Bloody Sunday 
        have been held accountable;
Whereas the lack of accountability and justice provided to those who perished 
        from the unlawful use of force on Bloody Sunday both erodes trust and is 
        dangerous;
Whereas accountability and justice for the victims of Bloody Sunday, along with 
        all victims of the Troubles, would represent a step towards addressing 
        Northern Ireland's legacy of violence and promote reconciliation;
Whereas an environment which fosters accountability and justice for the events 
        of the Troubles must be established by the Government of the United 
        Kingdom and maintained;
Whereas the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement with a devolved 
        government in Northern Ireland as well as healthy ``north-south'' and 
        ``east-west'' relations provides appropriate, useful, and productive 
        avenues for discussion and negotiation to prevent violence, uphold 
        peace, maintain stability, and promote the interests of all parties and 
        communities involved;
Whereas the avoidance of a hard border on the island of Ireland is essential for 
        maintaining the peace resulting from the Good Friday Agreement;
Whereas the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol as agreed upon 
        as part of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union will 
        assist in preserving peace and stability on the island of Ireland;
Whereas while progress has been made in fostering peace in Northern Ireland and 
        on the island of Ireland in recent decades, it is in the interest of all 
        parties to foster intercommunity discussions and relations as well as 
        integration in civil and societal structures to promote communication 
        and mutual understanding; and
Whereas on January 30, 2022, peace activists, concerned individuals, and the 
        descendants of those lost to this violence gathered in Derry to mourn, 
        to stand in solidarity with victims' families in their search for 
        justice, and re-commit themselves to the peace process established by 
        the Good Friday Agreement: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) condemns the violence and killing of 14 individuals on Bloody 
        Sunday 50 years ago and supports justice for the victims and their 
        families;
            (2) calls on all parties to take meaningful steps toward peace and 
        reconciliation and to ensure justice for victims of the Bloody Sunday 
        massacre as well as all those affected by the Troubles by supporting 
        dialogue and negotiation between all parties;
            (3) urges the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement to 
        ensure peace and stability on the island of Ireland;
            (4) recognizes the findings of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, also known 
        as the Saville Inquiry, and calls upon the Government of the United 
        Kingdom to support prosecutions of individuals who committed 
        unjustifiable crimes on Bloody Sunday based on the evidence collected;
            (5) opposes any proposal by the Government of the United Kingdom to 
        implement amnesty or statute of limitation laws that would end or 
        inhibit investigations and prosecutions of crimes committed during the 
        Troubles, including on Bloody Sunday;
            (6) calls upon the involved parties to facilitate the implementation 
        of the Northern Ireland Protocol in the interest of maintaining peace 
        and stability on the island of Ireland;
            (7) urges the European Union, including the Republic of Ireland, and 
        the United Kingdom to act in good faith with regard to negotiations 
        around Brexit and implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol;
            (8) calls on the people of Northern Ireland to foster further 
        integration across communities and break down cultural, religious, and 
        societal barriers that remain;
            (9) supports the devolved government of Northern Ireland and 
        recognizes the devolved government as a successful outcome and tenet of 
        the Good Friday Agreement; and
            (10) supports the continued strong governmental, societal, and 
        cultural relationships between the peoples of the United States, the 
        United Kingdom, and the Republic of Ireland.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.
