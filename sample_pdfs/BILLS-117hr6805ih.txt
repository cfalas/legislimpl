To amend title 54, United States Code, to establish within the National 
    Park Service the United States African-American Burial Grounds 
             Preservation Program, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``African-American Burial Grounds 
Preservation Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds that--
            (1) during the period beginning in 1619 and ending in 1865, 
        millions of African Americans throughout the United States were 
        enslaved;
            (2) slaveholders often--
                    (A) controlled where and how deceased slaves were 
                buried; and
                    (B) prohibited the burial of slaves on valuable 
                land;
            (3) as a result of the practices described in paragraph 
        (2), slave burial grounds were often confined to remote areas 
        or marginal property;
            (4) slave burial grounds--
                    (A) were rarely documented; and
                    (B) infrequently appear on historical maps;
            (5) a lack of accurate information is typical of African-
        American cemeteries originating before the Civil War;
            (6) following the end of slavery, many African-American 
        families continued to face restrictions on where the deceased 
        could be buried;
            (7) across many areas of the United States, local laws 
        segregated burial sites by race;
            (8) African-American burial grounds often failed to receive 
        the type of maintenance and recordkeeping that predominantly 
        White burial grounds enjoyed;
            (9) many African-American burial grounds from before and 
        after the Civil War are in a state of disrepair or 
        inaccessibility due to overgrowth of vegetation, crumbling 
        physical structures, and other challenges;
            (10) there is no official national record or database for 
        African-American burial ground locations;
            (11) the location of many African-American burial sites is 
        unknown;
            (12) as a result of the issues described in paragraphs (10) 
        and (11), the family members and descendants of the individuals 
        interred are unable to visit the burial sites to honor and 
        remember their ancestors;
            (13) abandoned African-American burial grounds are often 
        discovered when construction projects inadvertently disturb 
        human remains, which slows or halts completion of the projects;
            (14) the presence and location of historic African-American 
        burial grounds should be recorded;
            (15) there should be coordinated national, State, local, 
        and Tribal efforts to preserve and restore African-American 
        burial grounds;
            (16) African-American burial grounds are an integral 
        component of the heritage of the United States; and
            (17) establishing a program to preserve previously 
        abandoned, underserved, and other African-American burial 
        grounds would help communities identify and record burial 
        grounds and preserve local history, while better informing 
        development decisions and community planning.

SEC. 3. PURPOSE.

    The purpose of this Act is to authorize the National Park Service 
to coordinate and facilitate Federal activities and non-Federal 
activities to identify, interpret, research, preserve, and record 
unmarked, previously abandoned, underserved, and other African-American 
burial grounds.
