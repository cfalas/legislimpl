                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the goals and ideals of Social Work Month and World Social 
                      Work Day on March 15, 2022.

Whereas, since its founding more than a century ago, the social work profession 
        has been dedicated to improving human well-being and enhancing the basic 
        needs of all people, especially the most vulnerable among us;
Whereas the theme of Social Work Month 2022, ``The Time is Right for Social 
        Work'', embodies how social workers have been an essential workforce in 
        responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, even as the Nation continues to 
        grapple with systemic racism, gender-based violence, homophobia, 
        transphobia, economic inequality, climate change, and other challenges;
Whereas social workers are a large, racially and socioeconomically diverse 
        mental and behavioral health workforce in the United States, and social 
        workers provide culturally competent, evidence-based services in the 
        community in a broad range of settings, including healthcare, schools, 
        community clinics, private practice, child welfare agencies, and 
        correctional facilities;
Whereas social workers continue to advocate for social justice and equal rights 
        for all, especially for vulnerable, underserved, and marginalized 
        people;
Whereas social work is one of the fastest growing professions in the United 
        States, with more than 700,000 social workers today and a projected 
        increase to 800,000 by 2028;
Whereas social workers are leaders in creating and implementing public policies 
        that improve health and well-being, strengthen the social fabric, and 
        ensure a more just society;
Whereas social workers serve in all levels of government, including Congress, 
        where there are 5 social workers currently in office;
Whereas social workers develop evidence-based interventions that address a 
        number of the most vexing problems facing society, and social workers 
        conduct cutting-edge research that informs both policy and practice;
Whereas there is a need--

    (1) to ensure accuracy of workforce data surrounding the social work 
profession so that data projections adequately reflect the depth and 
breadth of social work practice across settings, as well as the needs of 
the clients and communities served by the profession; and

    (2) to make meaningful investments in the social work profession to 
address challenges associated with recruitment and retention in recognition 
of the pressing need for such professionals and the crucial services they 
provide; and

Whereas social workers meet individuals no matter where those individuals are in 
        their life circumstances and empower those individuals to fulfill their 
        potential: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of Social Work Month and 
        World Social Work Day on March 15, 2022;
            (2) acknowledges the diligent efforts of individuals and 
        groups who promote the importance of social work and observe 
        Social Work Month and World Social Work Day;
            (3) encourages individuals to engage in appropriate 
        ceremonies and activities to promote further awareness of the 
        life-changing role that social workers play; and
            (4) recognizes with gratitude the contributions of the 
        millions of social workers who have advanced individual, 
        family, and community well-being since the founding of the 
        social work profession more than a century ago.
