                               RESOLUTION


 
 Supporting the designation of the week of April 24 through April 30, 
           2022, as ``National Crime Victims' Rights Week''.

Whereas crime and victimization in the United States have significant, and 
        sometimes life-shattering, impacts on victims, survivors, and 
        communities across the United States;
Whereas research suggests that there are several million violent victimizations 
        each year in the United States, yet less than half of all violent crimes 
        are ever reported to police;
Whereas crime victims and survivors need and deserve support and access to 
        services to help them cope with the physical, psychological, financial, 
        and other adverse effects of crime;
Whereas Congress has recognized the importance of supporting crime victims and 
        survivors through the passage of legislation concerning this important 
        issue, including--

    (1) the Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (34 U.S.C. 20101 et seq.);

    (2) the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (34 U.S.C. 12291 et seq.);

    (3) the Survivors' Bill of Rights Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-236; 130 
Stat. 966);

    (4) the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act (42 U.S.C. 10401 et 
seq.);

    (5) the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2000 (22 U.S.C. 7101 et 
seq.);

    (6) the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act (34 U.S.C. 21701 et 
seq.);

    (7) the Amy, Vicky, and Andy Child Pornography Victim Assistance Act of 
2018 (Public Law 115-299; 132 Stat. 4383);

    (8) the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, 
and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act (Public Law 108-405; 118 Stat. 
2261); and

    (9) the Justice for All Act of 2004 (Public Law 108-405; 118 Stat. 
2260);

Whereas crime can touch the life of any individual, regardless of the age, race, 
        national origin, religion, or gender of that individual;
Whereas a just society acknowledges the impact of crime on individuals, 
        families, schools, and communities by protecting the rights of crime 
        victims and survivors;
Whereas crime victims and survivors in the United States, and the families of 
        those victims and survivors, need and deserve support and assistance to 
        help cope with the often devastating consequences of crime;
Whereas, since Congress adopted the first resolution designating Crime Victims 
        Week in 1985, communities across the United States have joined Congress 
        and the Department of Justice in commemorating National Crime Victims' 
        Rights Week to celebrate a shared vision of a comprehensive and 
        collaborative response that identifies and addresses the many needs of 
        crime victims and survivors and the families of those victims and 
        survivors;
Whereas the Senate applauds the work of crime victims advocates to ensure that 
        all crime victims and survivors, and the families of those victims and 
        survivors, are--

    (1) treated with dignity, fairness, and respect;

    (2) offered support and services, regardless of whether the victims and 
survivors report crimes committed against them; and

    (3) recognized as key participants within the criminal, juvenile, 
Federal, and Tribal justice systems in the United States when the victims 
and survivors report crimes; and

Whereas the Senate recognizes and appreciate the continued importance of--

    (1) promoting the rights of, and services for, crime victims and 
survivors; and

    (2) honoring crime victims and survivors, and the individuals who 
provide services for those victims and survivors: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) supports the designation of the week of April 24 
        through April 30, 2022, as ``National Crime Victims' Rights 
        Week'';
            (2) recognizes that crime victims and survivors, and the 
        families of those victims and survivors, should be treated with 
        dignity, fairness, and respect;
            (3) applauds the work carried out by thousands of victim 
        assistance organizations and agencies that serve crime 
        survivors at the local, State, Federal, and Tribal levels;
            (4) remains committed to funding programs authorized by the 
        Victims of Crime Act of 1984 (34 U.S.C. 20101 et seq.) and the 
        Violence Against Women Act of 1994 (34 U.S.C. 12291 et seq.), 
        among other Federal programs, which help thousands of public, 
        community-based, and Tribal victim and survivor assistance 
        organizations and agencies that provide essential, and often 
        life-saving, services to millions of crime victims throughout 
        the United States; and
            (5) encourages the observance of the 41st anniversary of 
        National Crime Victims' Rights Week with appropriate public 
        awareness, education, and outreach activities.
