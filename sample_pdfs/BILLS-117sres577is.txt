                               RESOLUTION


 
       Designating April 2022 as ``Parkinson's Awareness Month''.

Whereas Parkinson's disease--

    (1) affects 1,000,000 individuals in the United States;

    (2) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the world;

    (3) is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic and 
environmental factors; and

    (4) is the 14th leading cause of death in the United States, according 
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;

Whereas it is estimated that, by the year 2037, the number of individuals with 
        Parkinson's disease in the United States will nearly double, and the 
        disease will cost the United States at least $79,000,000,000 annually;
Whereas the symptoms of Parkinson's disease can include dementia and cognitive 
        impairment, tremors, slowness of movement, ``freezing'' in place, 
        inability to walk and maintain balance, speech difficulties, depression, 
        losing the ability to swallow, and a variety of other symptoms;
Whereas there are millions of family caregivers, friends, and loved ones whose 
        lives are greatly affected by Parkinson's disease; and
Whereas more research, education, and community support services are needed to--

    (1) find better treatments and a cure for Parkinson's disease; and

    (2) maintain dignity for those living with the disease today: Now, 
therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 2022 as ``Parkinson's Awareness 
        Month'';
            (2) supports the goals and ideals of Parkinson's Awareness 
        Month;
            (3) continues to support research to find better treatments 
        and a cure for Parkinson's disease;
            (4) recognizes the individuals living with Parkinson's 
        disease who participate in vital clinical trials to advance the 
        knowledge of the disease; and
            (5) commends the dedication of organizations, volunteers, 
        researchers, and millions of individuals across the country 
        working to improve the quality of life of people living with 
        Parkinson's disease and their families.
