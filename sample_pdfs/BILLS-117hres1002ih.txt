                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that Vice 
President Kamala Harris should be removed from her position as the head 
 of the Biden administration's strategy to address the root causes of 
                               migration.

Whereas, on March 24, 2021, Vice President Kamala Harris was named ``Border 
        Czar'' in charge of leading efforts to stem migration across the United 
        States-Mexico border;
Whereas Vice President Harris has visited the southern border once since 
        President Biden appointed her to lead efforts to stem migration across 
        the United States-Mexico border;
Whereas border security is national security and the ongoing influx of migrants 
        poses a significant threat to the public health and safety of our 
        communities;
Whereas, under the Biden administration, a historic number of illegal 
        immigrants, violent criminals, and deadly drugs have flooded into our 
        communities through the southern border;
Whereas over two million migrants illegally crossed our southern border in the 
        fiscal year 2021;
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reported a 1,066 percent 
        increase in fentanyl seized at eight southern Texas ports during fiscal 
        year 2021 under President Biden;
Whereas the Biden administration has allowed for mass migration to the United 
        States by allowing politics to cloud its judgment when assessing 
        policies;
Whereas our southern border is less safe now than it ever has been; and
Whereas U.S. Customs and Border Protection is underfunded and lacks resources 
        needed due to Vice President Harris's refusal to address the issues: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges the Biden 
administration to--
            (1) remove Vice President Kamala Harris as the head of any 
        executive branch task force or strategy relating to 
        immigration;
            (2) appoint an experienced and competent leader to replace 
        Vice President Kamala Harris as the head of the Biden 
        administration's strategy to address the root causes of 
        migration;
            (3) recognize that border security is national security;
            (4) immediately provide U.S. Customs and Border Protection 
        with the adequate support and resources to do their job 
        effectively and adequately;
            (5) take action to protect American communities from 
        fentanyl; and
            (6) stop allowing politics in Washington to cloud their 
        judgment regarding policies implemented at the southern border.
