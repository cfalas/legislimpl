        rental property)'' before the comma at the end.
            (3) Conforming amendment.--The table contained in section 
        168(c) of such Code is amended--
                    (A) by striking the row relating to residential 
                rental property, and

                real property.
    (b) Adjustment of Deduction To Provide Neutral Cost Recovery.--
Section 168 of such Code is amended by adding at the end the following 
new subsection:
    ``(n) Neutral Cost Recovery for Nonresidential Real Property and

            ``(1) In general.--The deduction otherwise provided under 
        section 167(a) with respect to nonresidential real property and 
        residential rental property for any taxable year shall be equal 
        to the product of such amount (determined without regard to 
        this subsection) multiplied by the applicable neutral cost 
        recovery ratio with respect to such property for such taxable 
        year.
            ``(2) Neutral cost recovery ratio.--For purposes of 
        paragraph (1), the term `applicable neutral cost recovery 
        ratio' means, with respect to any property for any taxable 
        year, the product (not less than 1 and rounded to the nearest

                        (as determined by the Bureau of Economic 
                        Analysis) for the calendar quarter ending in 
                        such taxable year which corresponds to the 
                        calendar quarter during which such property was

                        (as determined by the Bureau of Economic 
                        Analysis) for the calendar quarter during which 
                        such property was placed in service by the 
                        taxpayer, multiplied by
                    ``(B) 1.03 to the nth power, where `n' is the 
                number of full years in the period beginning on the 1st 
                day of the calendar quarter during which such property 
                was placed in service by the taxpayer and ending on the 
                day before the beginning of the corresponding calendar 
                quarter ending during such taxable year.
            ``(3) Application to property placed in service before date 
        of enactment.--In the case of nonresidential real property or

        the date of enactment of this subsection, subparagraphs (A)(i), 
        (A)(ii), and (B) of paragraph (2) shall each be applied by 
        substituting `calendar quarter which includes the date of 
        enactment of this subsection' for `calendar quarter during 
        which such property was placed in service by the taxpayer'.
            ``(4) Additional deduction not to affect basis or 
        recapture.--
                    ``(A) In general.--The additional amount determined 
                under this section by reason of this subsection shall 
                not be taken into account in determining the adjusted 
                basis of any applicable property or of any interest in 
                a pass-thru entity which holds such property and shall 
                not be treated as a deduction for depreciation for
