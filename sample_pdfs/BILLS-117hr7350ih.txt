            ``(2) Special rule for delayed 2020 unemployment 
        compensation.--In the case of any taxable year beginning in 
        2021, if a taxpayer is issued an unemployment compensation 
        payment with respect to calendar year 2020 but such payment is 
        not received by the taxpayer until 2021, the gross income of 
        such taxpayer shall not include so much of the unemployment 
        compensation received by such taxpayer as does not exceed 
        $10,200.
            ``(3) $10,200 aggregate limitation.--The total amount 
        excluded from gross income with respect to a taxpayer under
