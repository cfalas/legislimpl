                               RESOLUTION


 
Honoring the life, achievements, and legacy of the Honorable Madeleine 
                              K. Albright.

Whereas, on May 15, 1937, the Honorable Madeleine K. Albright was born in Prague 
        to Josef Korbel, a Czechoslovak diplomat, and his wife Anna;
Whereas Albright and her family were forced to flee to Britain in 1939, due to 
        the Nazi occupation of Czechoslovakia;
Whereas Albright and her family returned to Prague after the war, only to be 
        forced to flee again in 1948, due to her father's opposition to 
        communism;
Whereas Albright and her family moved to the United States as refugees seeking 
        political asylum, and Albright became a naturalized United States 
        citizen in 1957;
Whereas Albright attended Wellesley College to study political science on a full 
        scholarship and graduated with honors;
Whereas Albright earned a certificate in Russian, a Master of Arts degree, and a 
        Doctor of Philosophy degree from Columbia University while raising 3 
        children;
Whereas, in 1982, Albright was appointed to the position of Research Professor 
        of International Affairs at the School of Foreign Service at Georgetown 
        University and to the position of Director of the Women in Foreign 
        Service Program at the university;
Whereas, in 1993, President Clinton appointed Albright Ambassador to the United 
        Nations, where she represented the interests of the United States on the 
        world stage and pushed for multilateral cooperation to confront 
        atrocities, playing a vital role in the involvement by the North 
        Atlantic Treaty Organization (referred to in this preamble as ``NATO'') 
        to prevent further atrocities and ethnic cleansing in the former 
        Yugoslavia;
Whereas, in 1997, Albright was nominated for the position of Secretary of State 
        and was unanimously confirmed by the Senate, becoming the first woman to 
        serve as Secretary of State;
Whereas, during her time as Secretary of State, Albright championed democracy 
        and human rights around the world, galvanized the international 
        community to prevent war crimes in Kosovo through NATO intervention, and 
        advocated for NATO to accept Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic as 
        members of NATO;
Whereas, upon returning to private life in 2001, Albright became a best-selling 
        author and successful businessperson, led the boards of a number of 
        organizations, and received the Presidential Medal of Freedom; and
Whereas, throughout her life, Albright passionately advocated for human rights, 
        including those of women and refugees, while remaining actively involved 
        in civil society: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors the life, achievements, and legacy of the 
        Honorable Madeleine K. Albright;
            (2) commends to future generations Albright's example as a 
        patriot and public servant in the pursuit of a more peaceful, 
        prosperous, and cooperative world order; and
            (3) extends its deepest condolences and sympathy to the 
        family and friends of the Honorable Madeleine K. Albright.
