                               RESOLUTION


 
   Supporting the designation of April 24 through April 30, 2022, as 
                ``National Crime Victims' Rights Week''.

Whereas the mission of the Congressional Crime Survivors and Justice Caucus is 
        to identify, address, and elevate the needs of crime survivors and all 
        United States jurisdictions affected by crime in a bipartisan manner, 
        without infringing on the rights of the accused, through Federal 
        legislation, congressional education, public awareness, and 
        collaboration with and support of victim assistance and allied 
        professionals and organizations nationwide;
Whereas crime, victimization, and mass violence incidents in the United States 
        have significant, often devastating impacts on victims, survivors, and 
        communities large and small;
Whereas, for over 40 years, ``National Crime Victims' Rights Week'' has 
        recognized and validated the impact of crime on victims and survivors, 
        and those who assist them;
Whereas the 2022 theme of ``National Crime Victims' Rights Week'', ``Rights, 
        access, equity for all victims'', reflects the national approach that is 
        needed to ensure that crime survivors' needs are identified and 
        addressed;
Whereas crime victims' advocates and service providers help crime survivors by 
        providing them with information about their rights and how to exercise 
        them;
Whereas crime victims' advocates and service providers increase access to 
        services and support for survivors by working together to eliminate 
        barriers to the ability to know about and receive quality, comprehensive 
        services, including the elimination of barriers related to age, gender, 
        ethnicity, race, faith, geography, socioeconomic status, sexual 
        orientation, or disability;
Whereas equity in victim or survivor services requires the people of the United 
        States, individually and collectively, to recognize that every single 
        person who is harmed by crime, whether they report it to law enforcement 
        or not, deserves to be treated with fairness, dignity, respect, and 
        support; and
Whereas the Congressional Crime Survivors and Justice Caucus and Congress commit 
        to the adoption of policies and programs that identify and meet the 
        needs of crime survivors across the United States, including the 
        strengthening and protection of the Victims of Crime Act, the Crime 
        Victims' Rights Act, and the Violence Against Women Act: Now, therefore, 
        be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) strongly supports the goals and theme of ``National 
        Crime Victims' Rights Week'', ``Rights, access, equity for all 
        victims'';
            (2) recognizes the outstanding efforts of over 12,000 
        victim assistance organizations and agencies that serve crime 
        survivors at the local, State, Tribal, national, and Federal 
        levels; and
            (3) encourages the people of the United States to commit to 
        ensuring that crime victims' rights and services are not only 
        commemorated annually, but practiced daily.
