                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Whereas the Federal Bureau of Investigation is investigating the bomb threats 
        made in January and February 2022 against HBCUs as racially or 
        ethnically motivated violent extremism and hate crimes;
Whereas a high-quality education is central to economic prosperity and social 
        well-being in the United States;
Whereas HBCUs provide educational and economic opportunities for postsecondary 
        students;
Whereas these institutions educate and produce a significant share of the 
        Nation's Black leaders and innovators;
Whereas as early as the 19th century, HBCUs were established in response to 
        discriminatory practices that excluded Black Americans from pursuing an 
        education in the United States;
Whereas, on January 5, 2022, at least 8 HBCUs received bomb threats, including 
        Howard University, Xavier University, University of Arkansas at Pine 
        Bluff, Prairie View A&M University, North Carolina Central University, 
        Florida Memorial University, Norfolk State University, and Spelman 
        College;
Whereas, on January 31, 2022, at least 6 HBCUs received bomb threats, including 
        Southern University and A&M, Howard University, Bethune-Cookman 
        University, Albany State University, Bowie State University, and 
        Delaware State University;
Whereas, on February 1, 2022, the first day of Black History Month, at least 18 
        HBCUs received bomb threats, including Shorter College, Philander Smith 
        College, Arkansas Baptist College, the University of the District of 
        Columbia, Howard University, Edward Waters University, Spelman College, 
        Fort Valley State University, Kentucky State University, Xavier 
        University, Coppin State University, Morgan State University, Jackson 
        State University, Alcorn State University, Mississippi Valley State 
        University, Rust College, Tougaloo College, and Harris-Stowe State 
        University;
Whereas HBCUs provide an environment of belonging, safety, and security for 
        Black students, faculty, and administrators; and
Whereas these threats against HBCUs disrupt campus environments, obstruct 
        educational opportunities, increase anxiety, and instill fear: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) condemns violence and the threat of violence against 
        HBCUs, including bomb threats made against several HBCUs on 
        January 5, 2022, January 31, 2022, and February 1, 2022; and
            (2) reaffirms the commitment of the United States Federal 
        Government to combat violence against HBCU students, faculty, 
        and staff.

            Passed the House of Representatives March 8, 2022.

            Attest:

                                                                 Clerk.
