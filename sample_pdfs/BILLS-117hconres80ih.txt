                         CONCURRENT RESOLUTION


 
  Commending the heroism of Olathe East High School Administrator Dr. 
Kaleb Stoppel and School Resource Officer Erik Clark in responding to a 
                     student armed with a firearm.

Whereas, on Friday, March 4, 2022, Olathe East High School Administrator Dr. 
        Kaleb Stoppel (in this preamble referred to as Dr. Stoppel) and School 
        Resource Officer Erik Clark (in this preamble referred to as Officer 
        Clark) were shot and wounded while engaging an armed student;
Whereas Dr. Stoppel's decision to remove the student from class and Officer 
        Clark's swift response to neutralize the shooter prevented the loss of 
        innocent lives at Olathe East High School;
Whereas Officer Clark has been a School Resource Officer at Olathe East High 
        School for 7 years and a law enforcement officer for 15 years; and
Whereas Dr. Stoppel has been the Assistant Principal and Athletic Director for 
        Olathe East High School for nearly 4 years and an educator for nearly 13 
        years: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) commends Administrator Dr. Kaleb Stoppel and School 
        Resource Officer Erik Clark for their heroic actions to protect 
        students and staff of Olathe East High School; and
            (2) recognizes Administrator Dr. Kaleb Stoppel and School 
        Resource Officer Erik Clark's years of dedication and service 
        to their community as an educator and a member of law 
        enforcement, respectively.
