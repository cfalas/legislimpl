                paragraph (1), the Governor shall allocate the funds to 
                local areas in accordance with the formula established 
                under subparagraph (B) for the purposes of paying the

                allocate the funds provided under paragraph (1) to

                including the number of one-stop centers in a local 
                area, the intensity of services provided by such 
                centers, the population served by such centers, the 
                services provided by such centers, and other factors 
                relating to the performance of such centers that the 
                State board determines are appropriate.

                the term ``costs of infrastructure'', used with respect 
                to a one-stop center, means the nonpersonnel costs that 
                are necessary for the general operation of the one-stop 
                center (whether for in-person or virtual service 
                delivery), including the rental costs of the 
                facilities, the costs of utilities and maintenance,

                assistive technology for individuals with

        classifications at least equal to the wage determination
