                                 A BILL


 
 To prohibit wildlife killing contests on public lands, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Prohibit Wildlife Killing Contests 
Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Wildlife killing contests are organized events in which 
        participants kill animals for cash, prizes, entertainment, or 
        other inducements. Judging categories for wildlife killing 
        contests include, but are not limited to, the number of animals 
        killed, the weight or the sex of animals killed, a tiered point 
        system by species killed, or the smallest or largest body or 
        body part size of animals killed.
            (2) Wildlife killing contests often target ecologically 
        important carnivores, including foxes, bobcats, and coyotes.
            (3) Scientific evidence does not support claims that 
        wildlife killing contests permanently reduce populations of 
        targeted species, increase populations of deer or other game 
        species, or prevent conflict between native carnivores, humans, 
        pets, and livestock.
            (4) Because participants often wastefully discard targeted 
        wildlife, wildlife killing contests do not embody the hunting 
        principles set forth by the North America Wildlife Conservation 
        Model, which includes a requirement that wildlife only be 
        killed for a legitimate purpose. As a result, numerous State 
        agencies and officials have recognized that these contests can 
        undermine public support for hunting and damage the reputation 
        of sportsmen and sportswomen who abide by traditional hunting 
        ethics.
            (5) As of March 1, 2022, Arizona, California, New Mexico, 
        Vermont, Massachusetts, Colorado, Maryland, and Washington have 
        banned wildlife killing contests that target certain species.
            (6) Wildlife killing contests held on Federal lands 
        undermine Federal wildlife management practices, public trust 
        duties, and conservation ethics.
