                                 A BILL


 
To require the Secretary of State to use the voice, vote, and influence 
of the United States to suspend participation of the Russian Federation 
                in certain international organizations.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Russian Federation Suspension Act of 
2022''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In March and April 2014, the Russian military invaded 
        and annexed the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea, and the Russian 
        Federation took action to establish pro-Russian separatist 
        States in the Donbas region of Ukraine.
            (2) The Russian Federation has failed to follow the cease-
        fire agreements established by the Minsk 1 and Minsk 2 accords, 
        and conflict has been present in Ukraine since such invasion 
        and annexation.
            (3) Throughout 2021, Russia amassed troops, weapon systems, 
        and hardware on the border of Russia and Ukraine.
            (4) On December 17, 2021, the Russian Federation presented 
        the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with a list of 
        security demands, including that NATO would never allow 
        Ukraine, or other former Soviet States, into the alliance. 
        These demands are non-starters for NATO and its ``open door 
        policy'', which dates to the alliance's founding, and gives no 
        third-party a say in such deliberations. These demands were 
        only offered as a justification for a Russian invasion.
            (5) On February 21, 2022, President Vladimir Putin 
        officially recognized the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk as 
        independent States despite international consensus that they 
        remain part of the sovereign territory of Ukraine.
            (6) On February 22, 2022, President Putin ordered Russian 
        troops to enter Donetsk and Luhansk on a ``peacekeeping 
        mission'' while setting the stage for a larger invasion.
            (7) On February 24, 2022, President Putin ordered Russian 
        forces to conduct a full-scale invasion, moving beyond the 
        regions of Donetsk and Luhansk and initiating attacks 
        throughout broader Ukrainian territory.
            (8) Russian forces continue to devastate Ukraine's 
        hospitals, schools, homes, and other civilian infrastructure 
        and to threaten nuclear power plants with heavy artillery, 
        multi-launch rocket systems, and munitions systems with no 
        regard for civilian casualties.
            (9) The Russian Federation's position on the United Nations 
        Human Rights Council and other multilateral organizations is 
        predicated on a commitment to international peace and security. 
        Russia has plainly violated this commitment with its actions.
            (10) The precedent for suspending countries from the United 
        Nations Human Rights Council is firm. In 2011, in the wake of 
        Muammar Al-Qadhafi's violent crackdown on anti-government 
        protestors, the United Nations General Assembly suspended 
        Libya's membership in the Council.
            (11) The grave violations of human rights and the war 
        crimes committed by the Russian Federation in its invasion of 
        Ukraine undermine the credibility of the United Nations Human 
        Rights Council while the Russian Federation continues to sit on 
        the council. It emboldens United States adversaries to continue 
        to threaten freedom, peace, and security without fear of being 
        diplomatically cut off from the international rules-based 
        order.
            (12) The Russian Federation has repeatedly abused 
        INTERPOL's mechanisms and procedures, including its Red 
        Notices, to harass and seek the arrest and transfer of 
        dissidents and opponents of the Kremlin.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States to--
            (1) seek suspension of the Russian Federation's membership 
        on the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council;
            (2) seek suspension of the Russian Federation's access to 
        INTERPOL systems, block issuance of Red Notices to the Russian 
        Federation, and not recognize Red Notices issued by the Russian 
        Federation;
            (3) seek suspension of the Russian Federation from the G20 
        grouping;
            (4) oppose any non-humanitarian loan, grant, or other 
        action in any international financial institution, including 
        the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, that could 
        provide resources or relief to the Russian Federation; and
            (5) support efforts to censure the Russian Federation in 
        other multilateral organizations, as appropriate.

SEC. 4. ACTIONS REQUIRED.

    The Secretary of State shall instruct the United States Ambassador 
to the United Nations and the United States representatives at other 
international organizations described in section 3 to use the voice, 
vote, and influence of the United States to--
            (1) call for the UN Human Rights Council to convene a 
        special session focused on the human rights violations 
        committed by the Russian Federation during its invasion of 
        Ukraine;

        Human Rights Council;
            (3) oppose the Russian Federation's access to INTERPOL 
        systems;
            (4) oppose the Russian Federation's participation and 
        membership in the G20 grouping;
            (5) oppose any development cooperation, official 
        development assistance, programmatic or other trust fund, loan 
        guarantee, or any other form of financial assistance to the 
        Russian Federation, other than assistance that would 
        immediately support a core United States national security 
        interest;
            (6) oppose any non-humanitarian loan, grant, or other 
        action by any international financial institution that could 
        provide financial resources or other relief to the Russian 
        Federation; and
            (7) support efforts to censure the Russian Federation in 
        other multilateral organizations, as appropriate.

SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA ON INTERPOL.

    The United States shall ban the Russian Federation from accessing 
any United States information held in databases maintained by INTERPOL, 
and United States law enforcement and executive agencies shall not 
recognize Red Notices issued by the Russian Federation.

SEC. 6. TERMINATION.

4, and 5 after determining and certifying to Congress that the Russian 
Federation has--
            (1) verifiably withdrawn all of its forces from all 
        territory of Ukraine that was not occupied or subject to 
        control by forces or proxies of the Government of the Russian 
        Federation before December 1, 2021; and
            (2) ceased all hostilities towards Ukraine.

Act, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the

            (1) A description of the voting power, shares, and 
        representation of the Russian Federation in the United Nations 
        and other multinational organizations.

        Federation employed at or above the P-1 level or equivalent in 
        the United Nations, other multinational organizations, and 
        international financial institutions in which the United States 
        is a member, accompanied by a classified assessment of such 
        citizens' impartiality and efforts, known or suspected, to 
        advance the policy priorities of the Russian Federation.
            (3) A report on efforts to implement the actions described
