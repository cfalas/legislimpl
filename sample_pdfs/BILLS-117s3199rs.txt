                                 A BILL


 
  To promote peace and democracy in Ethiopia, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    This Act may be cited as the ``Ethiopia Peace and 
Democracy Promotion Act of 2021''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    In this Act:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The 
        term ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the 
        Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee 
        on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the 
        Secretary of State.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    Congress makes the following findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The United States and the Federal Democratic 
        Republic of Ethiopia share an important relationship and more 
        than a century of diplomatic relations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) Ethiopia is the second most populous country 
        in Africa and plays a key role in advancing security and 
        stability across sub-Saharan Africa, including as a top 
        contributor of uniformed personnel to United Nations 
        peacekeeping missions and as host country to the African 
        Union.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) Amid proliferating popular protests in 2018, 
        against decades of authoritarian rule, Ethiopia's governing 
        Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) 
        selected Abiy Ahmed as Prime Minister, who upon taking office 
        embarked on a program of political and economic reform that was 
        soon encumbered by widespread inter-communal conflict, 
        political assassinations, and democratic backsliding.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) Tensions between Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed and 
        the leadership of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF), 
        who, until 2019, were EPRDF coalition partners, deteriorated 
        significantly throughout 2019-2020, with the EPRDF's 
        transformation into the Prosperity Party (PP), the Federal 
        Government of Ethiopia's postponement of the 2020 elections, 
        and the TPLF's decision to hold elections in Tigray Regional 
        State of Ethiopia despite Federal objections, all serving as 
        major catalysts.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) In the early hours of November 4, 2020, Prime 
        Minister Abiy ordered a military offensive in response to an 
        attack by the TPLF on the Northern Command of the Ethiopian 
        National Defense Forces (ENDF), which TPLF officials have 
        asserted was an act of self-defense in the face of an imminent 
        invasion by Federal forces.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) Throughout November 2020, hostilities between 
        the ENDF and forces loyal to the TPLF evolved into a large-
        scale armed conflict that also involved the Eritrean Defense 
        Forces (EDF) and Amhara regional forces and militia fighting in 
        support of the Federal Government.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) Despite repeated calls from the United States 
        and its international partners for a full and verifiable 
        Eritrean withdrawal from Ethiopia, which date back to November 
        2020, Eritrean forces remain in Ethiopia.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) Fighting between TPLF aligned forces and the 
        ENDF and its allies persists in parts of Tigray, and has spread 
        to Amhara and Afar, and is estimated to have resulted in the 
        deaths of tens of thousands of individuals, prompted more than 
        61,000 Ethiopians to seek refuge in Sudan, and internally 
        displaced over 2,000,000.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) The war has disrupted harvests, livelihoods, 
        markets, and banking, and critical public infrastructure was 
        systematically looted and destroyed during the course of the 
        conflict, including health centers and schools, with the 
        majority of the reports implicating the ENDF, the EDF, and 
        allied militia. Supply chains and food were allegedly looted by 
        ENDF, EDF, and allied militia, which collectively contributed 
        to conditions that have resulted in 400,000-900,000 Ethiopians 
        living in famine-like conditions and a further 1,800,000 close 
        to that threshold, according to an analysis issued in June 
        2021.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) Interruptions in electricity, internet, and 
        telephone services imposed by the Federal Government of 
        Ethiopia continue to hamper humanitarian relief efforts and 
        enable impunity from armed actors on all sides of the conflict 
        by restricting the flow of information about human rights and 
        humanitarian conditions in the region.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (11) Despite repeated assurances from the Federal 
        Government of Ethiopia that it would allow unfettered 
        humanitarian access to Tigray, it continues to impose wide-
        ranging bureaucratic obstacles that impede the relief efforts 
        of international humanitarian organizations, and encourage and 
        deploy hostile rhetoric toward international humanitarian 
        organizations that endanger the safety and security of their 
        staff on the ground.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (12) Twenty-three aid workers have been killed in 
        the course of the conflict in northern Ethiopia, including an 
        aid worker employed by a United States Agency for International 
        Development implementing partner, who was reportedly executed 
        by Ethiopian and Eritrean forces in May 2021, and 3 Doctors 
        Without Borders employees in June 2021, by unknown armed 
        actors.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (13) Parties to the conflict in northern Ethiopia 
        have been accused of extra-judicial killings, rape, and ethnic 
        cleansing that may amount to war crimes, crimes against 
        humanity, and genocide.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (14) Two Eritrean refugee camps in Tigray, 
        Shimelba and Hitsats, were attacked and destroyed by armed 
        actors in November 2020 through January 2021, and refugees 
        subjected to killings, abductions, and forced 
        returns.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (15) As of October 31, 2021, total United States 
        Government humanitarian assistance in fiscal years 2020 and 
        2021 for the northern Ethiopia crisis response totaled 
        $617,387,662, making it the single largest donor of 
        humanitarian aid to the humanitarian crisis in northern 
        Ethiopia since the conflict began.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (16) In July 2021, TPLF aligned forces launched 
        military operations into some occupied portions neighboring 
        Amhara and Afar regions, displacing hundreds of thousands of 
        Amhara and Afar civilians, and giving rise to allegations of 
        serious abuses by Tigrayan forces against civilians in those 
        two regions, as well as against Eritrean refugees residing in 
        the Mai Aini and Adi Harush camps.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (17) The TPLF's July 2021 offensive was followed 
        by reports of escalating abuses against Tigrayan civilians in 
        various parts of Ethiopia and the alleged killing of Tigrayans 
        in Humera, all of which occur within a context of incendiary 
        and ethnicized public statements from Ethiopian officials and 
        media platforms.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (18) The Federal Government of Ethiopia responded 
        to TPLF offensives in July through August 2021 by pursuing mass 
        military mobilization, including the mobilization of regional 
        special forces and ethnic militia from various parts of the 
        country, in an effort to thwart and roll back TPLF 
        operations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (19) In August 2021, officials from the TPLF and 
        Oromo Liberation Army (OLA), a rebel group engaged in armed 
        struggle primarily in the Oromia region, publicly confirmed 
        they had entered an alliance designed to coordinate their 
        military operations against the Federal Government of Ethiopia, 
        developments which occurred against the backdrop of TPLF 
        advances in Amhara region and increased OLA activity in 
        Oromia.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (20) In September 2021, the Federal Government of 
        Ethiopia announced it was expelling seven senior United Nations 
        officials, and in October 2021 commenced an air offensive on 
        the Tigrayan capital, Mekele, which has further exacerbated the 
        inability of international aid organizations to deliver 
        food.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (21) In October, state-owned Ethiopia Television 
        reported that Prime Minister Abiy stated that, ``[i]f we make 
        sure that this thing called wheat [food aid] does not enter 
        Ethiopia, 70 per cent of Ethiopia's problems will be solved,'' 
        implying that he may stop the delivery of international food 
        aid altogether.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (22) In October 2021, a United Nations 
        Humanitarian Air Services flight that had been cleared by 
        Federal authorities to land in Mekelle to deliver food aid was 
        forced to abort landing due to air raids, threatening the lives 
        of 11 United Nations and non-governmental staff on 
        board.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (23) In the wake of military advances by the 
        Tigray Defense Forces in late October 2021, Prime Minister Abiy 
        urged citizens to take up arms to defend themselves, and on 
        November 2, 2021, Ethiopia declared a 6-month state of 
        emergency.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (24) On November 3, 2021, the Office of the High 
        Commissioner for Human Rights released the Joint Investigation 
        into Alleged Violations of International Human Rights, 
        Humanitarian and Refugee Law Committed by all Parties to the 
        Conflict in the Tigray Region of the Federal Democratic 
        Republic of Ethiopia, which found that ``attacks on civilians 
        and civilian objects, as well as indiscriminate attacks by 
        ENDF, EDF, and TSF Tigray Special Forces] in violation of 
        international humanitarian law . . . may amount to war 
        crimes,'' and that ``these groups and affiliated militia 
        committed acts in violation of international human rights law 
        and international humanitarian law''.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (25) The escalating conflict between the Federal 
        Government of Ethiopia and its allies and the TPLF and OLA 
        occurs in the context of a broader deterioration of political 
        conditions across the country, including persistent inter-
        communal violence, expanding repression against journalists, 
        opposition parties, and dissident voices, and highly 
        contentious national elections conducted in June to July 2021 
        that did not meet internationally accepted standards.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (26) Ethiopia's crisis is nested within a complex 
        regional environment, the most important dimensions of which 
        are three-way tensions between Ethiopia, Egypt, and Sudan over 
        the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam border tensions between 
        Sudan and Ethiopia over Al Fashaga, Eritrea's muscular regional 
        engagement, and increasing geopolitical competition in the Horn 
        of Africa that involves the Gulf, Turkey, Iran, Russia, and the 
        People's Republic of China.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (27) Working in conjunction with its international 
        partners, the United States has consistently called for a 
        political solution to the crisis, unfettered humanitarian 
        access, an end to human rights violations, full accountability 
        for all atrocities committed during the course of hostilities, 
        and a broader all-inclusive national dialogue, and has taken a 
        number of actions to encourage and incentivize a peaceful 
        resolution to the conflict in Ethiopia, including reductions in 
        development and security assistance, visa sanctions, and high-
        level diplomatic engagement.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (28) On September 17, 2021, President Joseph R. 
        Biden signed Executive Order No. 14046 ``Imposing Sanctions on 
        Certain Persons With Respect to the Humanitarian and Human 
        Rights Crisis in Ethiopia,'' which authorizes the United States 
        to target parties responsible for or complicit in actions or 
        policies that prolong the conflict in northern Ethiopia, and 
        those that commit human rights abuses, or obstruct humanitarian 
        access and a ceasefire with respect to the conflict.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (29) The Federal Government of Ethiopia has 
        rejected all offers to facilitate a diplomatic solution to the 
        conflict, including those extended by African Union Chairman 
        Cyril Ramaphosa in November 2020, and Intergovernmental 
        Authorities on Development (IGAD) Chairman Abdalla Hamdok in 
        August 2021, to mediate talks with the TPLF.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    It is the policy of the United States to support a 
peaceful, democratic unified Ethiopia, and to use all diplomatic, 
development, and legal tools to support an end to the conflict that 
began in northern Ethiopia, an end to violence throughout Ethiopia, the 
promotion of an all-inclusive national dialogue, and the advancement of 
the human, civil, and political rights of all Ethiopians.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 7. ACTIONS IN SUPPORT OF PEACE AND STABILITY IN 
              ETHIOPIA.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Sanctions for Actions Undermining Transition to 
Democracy.--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) In general.--The President shall impose the 
        sanctions described in paragraph (2) with respect to any 
        foreign person that the President determines--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) undermines efforts with respect to a 
                peaceful negotiated settlement to end hostilities in 
                northern Ethiopia;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) through business dealings with senior 
                leadership of the Government of Ethiopia or the 
                Government of Eritrea, the Tigray People's Liberation 
                Front, or other parties to the conflict in and around 
                northern Ethiopia, derives significant financial 
                benefit or political power from policies or actions, 
                including electoral fraud, human rights abuses, or 
                corruption, that contribute to the conflict or impede a 
                transition to democracy in Ethiopia;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) provides to any party involved in 
                hostilities in Ethiopia--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) weapon systems, such as 
                        firearms, unmanned aerial systems, helicopters, 
                        munitions used by such unmanned aerial systems 
                        or helicopters, battle tanks, armored combat 
                        vehicles, or munitions for such tanks and 
                        vehicles, missiles or missile systems; armed 
                        vehicles; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) support for such systems, 
                        such as ammunition, spare parts, pilots or 
                        other operators; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) knowingly facilitates or finances the 
                sale, operation, or transfer of weapons to any party 
                involved in hostilities in Ethiopia.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

        in the Horn of Africa;
            (2) northern Ethiopia has suffered from a prolonged 
        blockade that has prevented the flow of humanitarian 
        assistance, medical supplies, and fuel and created an 
        unprecedented humanitarian crisis;
            (3) all parties to the civil conflict should immediately 
        end hostilities and allow unfettered access to deliver 
        humanitarian aid, negotiate a ceasefire, and begin negotiations 
        towards a sustainable peace agreement;
            (4) the Government of Eritrea must immediately and

        all arms and materiel to all parties to the conflict;
            (6) the United States and the international community

        need of assistance, with an urgent focus on the provision of 
        emergency food aid to communities that are currently facing 
        famine conditions or food insecurity;
            (7) the United States should provide assistance for a 
        peaceful negotiated settlement to the civil conflict, including 
        assistance for stabilization, mitigation, reconciliation, and 
        democracy strengthening;
            (8) the United States should impose restrictions on 
        security and other related assistance;
            (9) all allegations of human rights abuses, war crimes, and 
        crimes against humanity must be thoroughly investigated by a 
        neutral credible body, and perpetrators must be held 
        accountable; and
            (10) the United States and international community should 
        seek to hold accountable governments, organizations, and 
        individuals, including those in the diaspora who have--
                    (A) incited the civil conflict and related violence 
                in Ethiopia; and
                    (B) spread disinformation as part or on behalf of a 
                foreign government, political party, ethnic group, or
