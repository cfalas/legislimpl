    (b) Guidance to Landlords of Privatized Housing.--Not later than

shall prescribe guidance for eligible entities and landlords regarding

            (1) Pilot program on using rental partnership programs of 
        the armed forces to assure tenants for developers of privatized 
        housing.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
        enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall establish 
        a pilot program to assess the feasibility of using the rental 
        partnership programs of the Armed Forces to assure tenants for 
        eligible entities to secure financing to construct privatized 
        housing.
                    (A) Locations.--The Secretary shall operate the 
                pilot program in no more than 10 military housing areas 
                that each have a rental vacancy rate of less than 7

                    (B) Term.--The pilot program shall terminate on the 
                date that is five years after the Secretary establishes

                termination of the pilot program, the Secretary shall 
                submit to Congress a report on the results of the pilot 
                program.

        housing, or to purchase or lease existing facilities, to house 
        members of the Armed Forces and their dependents, and low-
        income individuals and families, as determined by the Secretary 
        of Housing and Urban Development.
                    (A) Eligible projects.--In order to be eligible for 
                an incentive under the pilot program, proposed 
                privatized housing shall ensure that a percentage of 
                such housing is reserved for members of the Armed 
                Forces and dependents of such members. Such percentage 
                shall vary proportionately to the value of the

                pilot program in areas that have the longest wait times 
                for on-base housing.
                    (C) Priority.--In selecting eligible entities, the 
                Secretaries shall give priority to entry-level housing 
                and projects with greater density.
                    (D) Term.--The pilot program shall terminate on the 
                date that is five years after the Secretary establishes 
                the pilot program.
                    (E) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the 
                termination of the pilot program, the Secretaries shall 
                submit to Congress a report on the results of the pilot 
                program.
            (3) Joint grant program.--The Secretary of Defense and

        and their dependents, and low-income individuals and families. 
        Household income limits for entities eligible to receive such a
