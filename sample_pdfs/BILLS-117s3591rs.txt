&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following 
findings:&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) The United States and Ecuador have a history 
        of bilateral cooperation grounded in mutual respect, shared 
        democratic values, and mutual security interests.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) On February 7, 2021, and April 11, 2021, 
        Ecuador held democratic elections that included parties from 
        across the political spectrum, paving the way for continued 
        progress towards strengthening democratic 
        institutions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) The United States and Ecuador share strategic 
        interests in strengthening Ecuador's democratic institutions, 
        generating inclusive economic growth, and building capacity in 
        law enforcement, anti-corruption, and conservation 
        efforts.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) The United States and Ecuador historically 
        have enjoyed strong commercial, investment, and economic ties, 
        yet Ecuador continues to face significant challenges to 
        inclusive economic development, including--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the heavy economic toll of the COVID-
                19 pandemic;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) vulnerabilities with respect to the 
                growing role of the People's Republic of China in the 
                financing and refinancing of Ecuador's debts, and in 
                strategic infrastructure projects and sectors of the 
                Ecuadorian economy; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) the need to develop and strengthen 
                open and transparent economic policies that strengthen 
                Ecuador's integration with global markets, inclusive 
                economic growth, and opportunities for upward social 
                mobility for the Ecuadorian people.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) Since its establishment in December 2019, the 
        United States Development Finance Corporation has provided more 
        than $440,000,000 in financing to Ecuador.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) Ecuador's justice system has taken important 
        steps to fight corruption and criminality and to increase 
        accountability. However, enduring challenges to the rule of law 
        in Ecuador, including the activities of transnational criminal 
        organizations, illicit mining, illegal, unreported, and 
        unregulated (IUU) fishing, and undemocratic actors, present 
        ongoing risks for political and social stability in 
        Ecuador.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) The activities undertaken by the Government of 
        the People's Republic of China in Ecuador, including its 
        development of the ECU-911 video surveillance and facial 
        recognition system, financing of the corruptly managed and 
        environmentally deleterious Coca Codo Sinclair Dam, and support 
        for illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing practices 
        around the Galapagos Islands, pose risks to democratic 
        governance and biodiversity in the country.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (8) Ecuador, which is home to several of the 
        Earth's most biodiverse ecosystems, including the Galapagos 
        Islands, the headwaters of the Amazon river, the Condor 
        mountain range, and the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve, has seen a 
        reduction in its rainforests between 1990 and 2016, due in part 
        to the incursion of criminal networks into protected 
        areas.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (9) On March 24, 2021, the Senate unanimously 
        approved Senate Resolution 22 (117th Congress), reaffirming the 
        partnership between the United States and the Republic of 
        Ecuador, and recognizing the restoration and advancement of 
        economic relations, security, and development opportunities in 
        both nations.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (10) On August 13, 2021, the United States and 
        Ecuador celebrated the entry into force of the Protocol to the 
        Trade and Investment Council Agreement between the Government 
        of the United States of America and the Government of the 
        Republic of Ecuador Relating to Trade Rules and Transparency, 
        recognizing the steps Ecuador has taken to decrease unnecessary 
        regulatory burden and create a more transparent and predictable 
        legal framework for foreign direct investment in recent 
        years.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the United States should take additional steps 
        to strengthen its bilateral partnership with Ecuador, including 
        by developing robust trade and investment frameworks, 
        increasing law enforcement cooperation, renewing the activities 
        of the United States Agency for International Development in 
        Ecuador, and supporting Ecuador's response to and recovery from 
        the COVID-19 pandemic, as necessary and appropriate; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) strengthening the United States-Ecuador 
        partnership presents an opportunity to advance core United 
        States national security interests and work with other 
        democratic partners to maintain a prosperous, politically 
        stable, and democratic Western Hemisphere that is resilient to 
        malign foreign influence.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 4. FACILITATING ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL TIES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary 
of Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of 
the Treasury, and the heads of other relevant Federal departments and 
agencies, as appropriate, shall develop and implement a strategy to 
strengthen commercial and economic ties between the United States and 
Ecuador by--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) promoting cooperation and information sharing 
        to encourage awareness of and increase trade and investment 
        opportunities between the United States and Ecuador;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) supporting efforts by the Government of 
        Ecuador to promote a more open, transparent, and competitive 
        business environment, including by lowering trade barriers, 
        implementing policies to reduce trading times, and improving 
        efficiencies to expedite customs operations for importers and 
        exporters of all sizes, in all sectors, and at all entry ports 
        in Ecuador;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) establishing frameworks or mechanisms to 
        review the long-term financial sustainability and security 
        implications of foreign investments in Ecuador in strategic 
        sectors or services;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) establishing competitive and transparent 
        infrastructure project selection and procurement processes in 
        Ecuador that promote transparency, open competition, financial 
        sustainability, and robust adherence to global standards and 
        norms;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) developing programs to help the Government of 
        Ecuador improve efficiency and transparency in customs 
        administration, including through support for the Government of 
        Ecuador's ongoing efforts to digitize its customs process and 
        accept electronic documents required for the import, export, 
        and transit of goods under specific international standards, as 
        well as related training to expedite customs, security, 
        efficiency, and competitiveness;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) spurring digital transformation that would 
        advance--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) the provision of digitized government 
                services with the greatest potential to improve 
                transparency, lower business costs, and expand 
                citizens' access to public services and public 
                information;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) the provision of transparent and 
                affordable access to the internet and digital 
                infrastructure; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) best practices to mitigate the risks 
                to digital infrastructure by doing business with 
                communication networks and communications supply chains 
                with equipment and services from companies with close 
                ties to or susceptible to pressure from governments or 
                security services without reliable legal checks on 
                governmental powers; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) identifying, as appropriate, a role for the 
        United States International Development Finance Corporation, 
        the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the United States Agency 
        for International Development, and the United States private 
        sector in supporting efforts to increase private sector 
        investment and strengthen economic prosperity.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 5. PROMOTING INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    The Administrator of the United States Agency for 
International Development, in coordination with the Secretary of State 
and the heads of other relevant Federal departments and agencies, as

programs to support inclusive economic development across Ecuador's 
national territory by--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) facilitating increased access to public and 
        private financing, equity investments, grants, and market 
        analysis for small and medium-sized businesses;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) providing technical assistance to local 
        governments to formulate and enact local development plans that

        including Indigenous and Afro-Ecuadorian agricultural networks, 
        to consumers in urban centers and export markets, including 
        through infrastructure construction and maintenance programs 
        that are subject to audits and carefully designed to minimize 
        potential environmental harm;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) partnering with local governments, the private 
        sector, and local civil society organizations, including 
        organizations representing marginalized communities and faith-
        based organizations, to provide skills training and investment 
        in support of initiatives that provide economically viable, 
        legal alternatives to participating in illegal economies; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) connecting small scale fishing enterprises to 
        consumers and export markets, in order to reduce vulnerability

              FOREIGN INFLUENCE.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    The Secretary of State shall develop and implement a

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) Strengthening Democratic Governance.--The Secretary of 
State, in coordination with the Administrator of the United States 
Agency for International Development, should develop and implement 
initiatives to strengthen democratic governance in Ecuador by 
supporting--&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        and subnational government institutions to govern through 
        transparent, inclusive, and democratic processes;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) efforts that measurably enhance the capacity

        institutions and the rule of law;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) initiatives to strengthen democratic 
        governance, including combating political, administrative, and

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The United States and Ecuador have a history of 
        bilateral cooperation grounded in mutual respect, shared 
        democratic values, and mutual security interests.
            (2) On February 7, 2021, and April 11, 2021, Ecuador held 
        democratic elections that included parties from across the 
        political spectrum, paving the way for continued progress 
        towards strengthening democratic institutions.
            (3) The United States and Ecuador share strategic interests 
        in strengthening Ecuador's democratic institutions, generating 
        inclusive economic growth, and building capacity in law 
        enforcement, anti-corruption, and conservation efforts.
            (4) The United States and Ecuador historically have enjoyed 
        strong commercial, investment, and economic ties, yet Ecuador 
        continues to face significant challenges to inclusive economic 
        development, including--
                    (A) the heavy economic toll of the COVID-19 
                pandemic;
                    (B) vulnerabilities with respect to the growing 
                role of the People's Republic of China in the financing 
                and refinancing of Ecuador's debts, and in strategic 
                infrastructure projects and sectors of the Ecuadorian 
                economy; and
                    (C) the need to develop and strengthen open and 
                transparent economic policies that strengthen Ecuador's 
                integration with global markets, inclusive economic 
                growth, and opportunities for upward social mobility 
                for the Ecuadorian people.
            (5) Since its establishment in December 2019, the United 
        States Development Finance Corporation has provided more than 
        $440,000,000 in financing to Ecuador.
            (6) Ecuador's justice system has taken important steps to 
        fight corruption and criminality and to increase 
        accountability. However, enduring challenges to the rule of law 
        in Ecuador, including the activities of transnational criminal 
        organizations, illicit mining, illegal, unreported, and 
        unregulated (IUU) fishing, and undemocratic actors, present 
        ongoing risks for political and social stability in Ecuador.
            (7) The activities undertaken by the Government of the 
        People's Republic of China in Ecuador, including its 
        development of the ECU-911 video surveillance and facial 
        recognition system, financing of the corruptly managed and 
        environmentally deleterious Coca Codo Sinclair Dam, and support 
        for illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing practices 
        around the Galapagos Islands, pose risks to democratic 
        governance and biodiversity in the country.
            (8) Ecuador, which is home to several of the Earth's most 
        biodiverse ecosystems, including the Galapagos Islands, the 
        headwaters of the Amazon river, the Condor mountain range, and 
        the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve, has seen a reduction in its 
        rainforests between 1990 and 2016, due in part to the incursion 
        of criminal networks into protected areas.
            (9) On March 24, 2021, the Senate unanimously approved 
        Senate Resolution 22 (117th Congress), reaffirming the 
        partnership between the United States and the Republic of 
        Ecuador, and recognizing the restoration and advancement of 
        economic relations, security, and development opportunities in 
        both nations.
            (10) On August 13, 2021, the United States and Ecuador 
        celebrated the entry into force of the Protocol to the Trade 
        and Investment Council Agreement between the Government of the 
        United States of America and the Government of the Republic of 
        Ecuador Relating to Trade Rules and Transparency, recognizing 
        the steps Ecuador has taken to decrease unnecessary regulatory 
        burden and create a more transparent and predictable legal 
        framework for foreign direct investment in recent years.

SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) the United States should take additional steps to 
        strengthen its bilateral partnership with Ecuador, including by 
        developing robust trade and investment frameworks, increasing 
        law enforcement cooperation, renewing the activities of the 
        United States Agency for International Development in Ecuador, 
        and supporting Ecuador's response to and recovery from the 
        COVID-19 pandemic, as necessary and appropriate; and
            (2) strengthening the United States-Ecuador partnership 
        presents an opportunity to advance core United States national 
        security interests and work with other democratic partners to 
        maintain a prosperous, politically stable, and democratic 
        Western Hemisphere that is resilient to malign foreign 
        influence.

SEC. 4. FACILITATING ECONOMIC AND COMMERCIAL TIES.

    The Secretary of State, in coordination with the Secretary of 
Commerce, the United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of the

Ecuador by--
            (1) promoting cooperation and information sharing to 
        encourage awareness of and increase trade and investment 
        opportunities between the United States and Ecuador;
            (2) supporting efforts by the Government of Ecuador to 
        promote a more open, transparent, and competitive business 
        environment, including by lowering trade barriers, implementing 
        policies to reduce trading times, and improving efficiencies to 
        expedite customs operations for importers and exporters of all 
        sizes, in all sectors, and at all entry ports in Ecuador;
            (3) establishing frameworks or mechanisms to review the 
        long term financial sustainability and security implications of 
        foreign investments in Ecuador in strategic sectors or 
        services;
            (4) establishing competitive and transparent infrastructure 
        project selection and procurement processes in Ecuador that 
        promote transparency, open competition, financial 
        sustainability, and robust adherence to global standards and 
        norms;
            (5) developing programs to help the Government of Ecuador 
        improve efficiency and transparency in customs administration, 
        including through support for the Government of Ecuador's 
        ongoing efforts to digitize its customs process and accept 
        electronic documents required for the import, export, and 
        transit of goods under specific international standards, as 
        well as related training to expedite customs, security, 
        efficiency, and competitiveness;
            (6) spurring digital transformation that would advance--
                    (A) the provision of digitized government services 
                with the greatest potential to improve transparency, 
                lower business costs, and expand citizens' access to 
                public services and public information;
                    (B) the provision of transparent and affordable 
                access to the internet and digital infrastructure; and
                    (C) best practices to mitigate the risks to digital 
                infrastructure by doing business with communication 
                networks and communications supply chains with 
                equipment and services from companies with close ties 
                to or susceptible to pressure from governments or 
                security services without reliable legal checks on 
                governmental powers; and
            (7) identifying, as appropriate, a role for the United 
        States International Development Finance Corporation, the 
        Millennium Challenge Corporation, the United States Agency for 
        International Development, and the United States private sector 
        in supporting efforts to increase private sector investment and 
        strengthen economic prosperity.

SEC. 5. PROMOTING INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

    The Administrator of the United States Agency for International 
Development, in coordination with the Secretary of State and the heads 
of other relevant Federal departments and agencies, as appropriate, 
shall develop and implement a strategy and related programs to support 
inclusive economic development across Ecuador's national territory by--
            (1) facilitating increased access to public and private 
        financing, equity investments, grants, and market analysis for

        alternatives to participating in illegal economies; and
            (5) connecting small scale fishing enterprises to consumers
