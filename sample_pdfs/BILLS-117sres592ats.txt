                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

    Mr. Casey (for himself and Mr. Cramer) submitted the following 
             resolution; which was considered and agreed to

_______________________________________________________________________

                               RESOLUTION


 
Designating April 6, 2022, as ``National Assistive Technology Awareness 
                                 Day''.

Whereas assistive technology is any item, piece of equipment, or product system 
        that is used to increase, maintain, or improve the functional 
        capabilities of an individual with a disability or an older adult;
Whereas an assistive technology service is any service that directly assists an 
        individual with a disability or an older adult in the selection, 
        acquisition, or use of an assistive technology device;
Whereas, in 2018, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 1 
        in 4 individuals in the United States, or almost 61,000,000 individuals, 
        has a disability;
Whereas, in the 2019-2020 school year, the Department of Education reported that 
        there were more than 7,300,000 children with disabilities;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that, among 
        adults 65 years of age and older, 2 in 5 have a disability;
Whereas assistive technology enables individuals with disabilities and older 
        adults to be included in their communities and in inclusive classrooms 
        and workplaces;
Whereas assistive technology devices and services are necessities, not luxury 
        items, for millions of individuals with disabilities and older adults, 
        without which they would be unable to live in their communities, access 
        education, or obtain, retain, and advance gainful, competitive, and 
        integrated employment;
Whereas the availability of assistive technology in the workplace promotes 
        economic self-sufficiency, enhances work participation, and is critical 
        to the employment of individuals with disabilities and older adults; and
Whereas State assistive technology programs support a continuum of services that 
        include--

    (1) the exchange, repair, recycling, and other reutilization of 
assistive technology devices;

    (2) device loan programs that provide short-term loans of assistive 
technology devices to individuals, employers, public agencies, and others;

    (3) the demonstration of devices to inform decision making; and

    (4) State financing to help individuals purchase or obtain assistive 
technology through a variety of initiatives, such as financial loan 
programs, leasing programs, and other financing alternatives, that give 
individuals affordable, flexible options to purchase or obtain assistive 
technology: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 6, 2022, as ``National Assistive 
        Technology Awareness Day''; and
            (2) commends--
                    (A) assistive technology specialists and program 
                coordinators for their hard work and dedication in 
                serving individuals with disabilities who are in need 
                of finding the proper assistive technology to meet 
                their individual needs; and
                    (B) professional organizations and researchers 
                dedicated to facilitating the access and acquisition of 
                assistive technology for individuals with disabilities 
                and older adults in need of assistive technology 
                devices.
