SEC. 2. GUIDANCE TO STATES ON FURNISHING BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES VIA 
              TELEHEALTH UNDER MEDICAID AND CHIP.

    Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the

issue guidance to States on the following:
            (1) State options for Federal reimbursement of expenditures

        behavioral health needs, including assessment, counseling, and 
        medication management, using telehealth services. Such options 
        shall include, to the extent appropriate, options for States to 
        receive Federal reimbursement for such expenditures without the 
        need for approval of a State plan amendment or waiver. Such 
        guidance shall also include guidance on furnishing services and 
        treatments that address the needs of high-risk individuals, 
        including racial and ethnic minorities, such as American 
        Indians and Alaska Natives.
            (2) State options for Federal reimbursement of expenditures 
        under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program for 
        furnishing clinically appropriate behavioral health services 
        and treatment to school-aged youth and teens enrolled in 
        Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program using 
        telehealth services. Such options shall include, to the extent 
        appropriate, options for States to receive Federal 
        reimbursement for such expenditures without the need for 
        approval of a State plan amendment or waiver.
            (3) Best practices for integrating clinically appropriate 
        behavioral health provided via telehealth services covered by a 
        State plan for medical assistance under title XIX of the Social 
        Security Act (or a waiver of such a plan) or a State plan for 
        child health assistance under title XXI of such Act (or a 
        waiver of such a plan) into school-based settings, including 
        full-service community schools. Such best practices shall 
        include resources and information specifically for educators 
        and other school-based staff on how to recognize signs of 
        distress in high-risk students and make appropriate referrals 
        for school-based behavioral health services.
            (4) Best practices for evaluating how utilizing clinically 
        appropriate telehealth services for behavioral health services 
        and treatment affects outcomes, as well as costs.
            (5) Best practices for monitoring fraud, waste, and abuse 
        that may occur during behavioral health services furnished 
        through telehealth services covered under Medicaid and the 
        Children's Health Insurance Program.
