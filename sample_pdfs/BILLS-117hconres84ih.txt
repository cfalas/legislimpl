  Supporting the goals and ideals of International Transgender Day of 
                              Visibility.

Whereas the International Transgender Day of Visibility was begun in 2009 to 
        honor the achievements and contributions of the transgender community;
Whereas the International Transgender Day of Visibility is designed to be 
        encompassing of a large community of people, including people who 
        identify as nonbinary, gender nonconforming, and gender-diverse;
Whereas International Transgender Day of Visibility is a time to celebrate 
        transgender, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, and gender-diverse people 
        around the world, and to recognize the bravery it takes to live openly 
        and authentically;
Whereas International Transgender Day of Visibility is also a time to raise 
        awareness of the discrimination and violence that the transgender 
        community still faces, which make it difficult and even unsafe and fatal 
        for many transgender people to be visible;
Whereas the transgender community has suffered disproportionately in many ways, 
        including by workplace and educational discrimination and being subject 
        to violence, and these forms of oppression are exacerbated for 
        transgender people of color, people with limited resources, immigrants, 
        people living with disabilities, and transgender youth;
Whereas a record number of antitransgender State bills have been introduced in 
        recent years;
Whereas the transgender community has made it clear that they will not be erased 
        and must be accorded all of the rights and opportunities made available 
        to all;
Whereas transgender, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, and gender-diverse people 
        continue to bravely tell their stories and push for full equity under 
        the law;
Whereas the civil rights struggle has been strengthened and inspired by the 
        leadership of the transgender community;
Whereas 23 States have at least 1 transgender elected official, and there are 12 
        transgender, gender nonconforming, and nonbinary elected officials in 
        State legislatures, including Danica Roem, Gerri Cannon, Cesar Chavez, 
        Brianna Titone, Lisa Bunker, Joshua Query, Sarah McBride, Stephanie 
        Byers, Taylor Small, Mauree Turner, Stacie Laughton, and Mike Simmons;
Whereas voters in the State of Delaware elected Sarah McBride as the Nation's 
        first openly transgender State senator;
Whereas voters in the State of Oklahoma elected Mauree Turner as the Nation's 
        first openly nonbinary State legislator;
Whereas, in the State of Illinois, Mike Simmons became the Nation's first openly 
        nonbinary or gender nonconforming State senator;
Whereas 4 States have a transgender jurist on the bench, including Judge Phyllis 
        Frye of Texas, Judge Victoria Kolakowski of California, Commissioner 
        Tracy Nadzieja of Arizona, and Judge Jill Rose Quinn of Illinois;
Whereas Admiral Rachel L. Levine, M.D., was the first openly transgender Federal 
        official confirmed by the United States Senate and is the highest 
        ranking openly transgender Federal Government official in United States 
        history;
Whereas Stella Keating became the first transgender teen to testify before the 
        United States Senate;
Whereas the first openly transgender person was elected student government 
        president at a major university;
Whereas 31 openly transgender athletes have competed at the college level, 
        including Schuyler Bailar, the first openly transgender athlete to 
        compete at the NCAA Division I level, and Lia Thomas, the first openly 
        transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I national championship;
Whereas Amy Schneider became the first transgender woman to qualify for the 
        Tournament of Champions on ``Jeopardy!'', and is also the highest 
        winning woman to win 40 games consecutively;
Whereas more transgender people are gracing the covers of magazines to raise 
        awareness of their gender identity and the importance of living 
        authentically;
Whereas transgender people have created culture and history as artists, 
        musicians, healers, workers, and organizers; and
Whereas International Transgender Day of Visibility is a time to celebrate the 
        transgender community around the world: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), 
That Congress--
            (1) supports the goals and ideals of the International 
        Transgender Day of Visibility;
            (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        the International Transgender Day of Visibility with 
        appropriate ceremonies, programs, and activities;
            (3) celebrates the accomplishments and leadership of 
        transgender, nonbinary, gender nonconforming, and gender-
        diverse people; and
            (4) recognizes the bravery of the transgender community as 
        it fights for equal dignity and respect.
