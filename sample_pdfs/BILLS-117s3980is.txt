    This Act may be cited as the ``Middle Market IPO Underwriting Cost 
Act''.

SEC. 2. STUDY ON IPO FEES.

    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) IPOs.--The term ``IPOs'' means initial public 
        offerings.
            (2) Small- and medium-sized companies.--The term ``small- 
        and medium-sized companies'' means issuers with an initial 
        public float determination of less than $700,000,000.
    (b) Study.--The Securities and Exchange Commission, in consultation 
with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, shall carry out a 
study of the costs associated with small- and medium-sized companies to 
undertake IPOs and Tier 2 offerings, as defined in section 230.251 of 
title 17, Code of Federal Regulations. In carrying out such study, the 
Commission shall--
            (1) consider the direct and indirect costs of an IPO, 
        including--
                    (A) fees, such as gross spreads paid to 
                underwriters, IPO advisors, and other professionals;
                    (B) compliance with Federal and State securities 
                laws at the time of the IPO; and
                    (C) such other IPO-related costs as the Commission 
                determines appropriate;
            (2) compare and analyze the costs of an IPO with the costs 
        of obtaining alternative sources of financing and of liquidity;
            (3) consider the impact of such costs on capital formation;
            (4) analyze the impact of these costs on the availability 
        of public securities of small- and medium-sized companies to 
        retail investors; and
            (5) analyze trends in IPOs over a time period the 
        Commission determines is appropriate to analyze IPO pricing 
        practices, considering--
                    (A) the number of IPOs;
                    (B) how costs for IPOs have evolved over time, 
                including fees paid to underwriters, investment 
                advisory firms, and other professions for services in 
                connection with an IPO;
                    (C) the number of brokers and dealers active in 
                underwriting IPOs;
                    (D) the different types of services that 
                underwriters and related persons provide before and 
                after a small- or medium-sized company IPO and the 
                factors impacting underwriting costs;
                    (E) changes in the costs and availability of 
                investment research for small- and medium-sized 
                companies; and
                    (F) any other consideration the Commission 
                considers necessary and appropriate.
    (c) Report.--Not later than the end of the 360-day period beginning 
on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Commission shall issue a 
report to Congress containing all findings and determinations made in 
carrying out the study required under subsection (b) and any 
administrative or legislative recommendations the Commission may have.
