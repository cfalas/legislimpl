    To amend the Ukraine Freedom Support Act of 2014 to require the 
 President to establish a semiconductor supply chain working group in 
   response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine and submit reports to 
     Congress on potential future disruptions to the supply chain.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Semiconductor Supply 
Chain Materials from Authoritarians Act''.

            (2) by inserting after section 10 the following new 
        sections:

``SEC. 11. WORKING GROUP ON SEMICONDUCTOR SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS.

    ``(a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of the 
enactment of this section, the President shall establish an interagency

                    ``(A) the impact of Russia's unprovoked attack on 
                Ukraine on the supply of palladium, neon gas, helium,
