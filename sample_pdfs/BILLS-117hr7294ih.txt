                                 A BILL


 
   To require public institutions of higher education to disseminate 
  information on the rights of, and accommodations and resources for, 
               pregnant students, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Pregnant Students' Rights Act''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Female students who are enrolled at institutions of 
        higher education and experiencing unplanned pregnancies may 
        face pressure that their only option is to receive an abortion 
        or risk academic failure.
            (2) 27.6 percent of all abortions in the United States are 
        performed on women of college age, between the ages of 20 and 
        24, according to a 2019 report by the Centers for Disease 
        Control and Prevention.
            (3) A significant proportion of abortions in the United 
        States are performed on women of college age who may be unaware 
        of their rights under title IX of the Education Amendments of 
        1972 (20 U.S.C. 1681) or deprived of an alternative to 
        receiving an abortion.
            (4) Additionally, women on college campuses may fear 
        institutional reprisal, loss of athletic scholarship, and 
        possible negative impact on academic opportunities.
            (5) An academic disparity exists because of the lack of 
        resources, support, and notifications available for female 
        college students who do not wish to receive an abortion or who 
        carry their unborn babies to term.

SEC. 3. NOTICE OF PREGNANT STUDENT RIGHTS, ACCOMMODATIONS, AND 
              RESOURCES.

    Section 485 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1092) is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
    ``(n) Pregnant Students' Rights, Accommodations, and Resources.--
