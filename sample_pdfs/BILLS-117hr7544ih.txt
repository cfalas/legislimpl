SECTION 1. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION.

    (a) In General.--An individual who is injured, and any member of 
the family of an individual who is killed, by use of a ghost gun in or 
affecting interstate or foreign commerce, and the State and the 
political subdivision of the State in which the injury or death occurs, 
may bring an action in the United States district court for the 
judicial district in which the injury or death occurs against the maker 
of any component of the ghost gun or any person who facilitated any 
sale of the ghost gun, for damages resulting from the injury or death. 
The court may award a plaintiff prevailing in such an action such 
damages, including consequential damages, as the court deems 
appropriate.
    (b) Affirmative Defenses.--In an action brought under subsection 
(a), it shall be an affirmative defense that the injury or death was 
caused by conduct of--
            (1) an individual in defense against a reasonably perceived 
        imminent threat to the safety of an individual not engaged in a 
        violation of criminal law; or
            (2) a law enforcement officer in response to a reasonably 
        perceived imminent threat to public safety.
    (c) Definitions.--In this section:
            (1) Ghost gun.--The term ``ghost gun'' means a firearm that 
        lacks a unique serial number engraved or cast on the frame or 
        receiver of the firearm by a licensed manufacturer or licensed 
        importer in accordance with section 923(i) of title 18, United 
        States Code, and includes any combination of parts designed or 
        intended to be assembled, or to be used in converting a device, 
        into a firearm.
            (2) Other terms.--The terms ``firearm'', ``licensed
