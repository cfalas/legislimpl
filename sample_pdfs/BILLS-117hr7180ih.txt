                                 A BILL


 
 To authorize the Director of the National Science Foundation to award 
   grants to support research on the disruption of regular cognitive 
 processes associated with COVID-19 infection, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Brycen Gray and Ben Price COVID-19 
Cognitive Research Act''.

SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.

    In this Act--
            (1) the term ``Director'' means the Director of the 
        National Science Foundation;
            (2) the term ``National Academies'' means the National 
        Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine; and
            (3) the term ``eligible entity'' means an institution of 
        higher education (as such term is defined in section 102 of the 
        Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1002)) or a consortium 
        composed of non-profit organizations and institutions of higher 
        education.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect 
        of life across the globe. Furthermore, it has produced major 
        disruptions of individual's physical and mental health, 
        including with respect of children and adolescents.
            (2) Historical epidemiological perspectives suggest an 
        association between exposure to general respiratory viruses and 
        subsequent disruption of regular cognitive processes.
            (3) Early research suggests that one in three individuals 
        diagnosed with a COVID-19 infection experiences a disruption of 
        regular cognitive processes within six months of such 
        diagnosis.
            (4) Research is urgently needed to better understand why 
        disruption in regular cognitive processes occur in patients as 
        a consequence of a COVID-19 infection and how long such 
        disruptions can continue after recovery.
            (5) The National Science Foundation has a deep history of 
        supporting interdisciplinary, basic research that spans the 
        social, behavioral, and fundamental biological sciences and 
        paves the way for scientific advancements.

SEC. 4. NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RESEARCH.

    The Director shall award grants to eligible entities, including 
through the RAPID funding mechanism, on a competitive, merit-reviewed 
basis to support interdisciplinary research on the disruption of 
regular cognitive processes associated with both short-term and long-
term COVID-19 infections, including with respect to children and 
adolescents. Such research may include the following:
            (1) Foundational studies on the effects of cognition, 
        emotion, and neural structure and function relating to any 
        disruption of regular cognitive processes associated with 
        COVID-19 infection.
            (2) Analysis of findings on the disruption of regular 
        cognitive processes associated with COVID-19 infection, 
        including the development of predictive theoretical frameworks 
        to guide future research.
            (3) Development of physical and conceptual tools needed to 
        evaluate cognition, emotion, and neural structure and function 
        of the brain as a consequence of a COVID-19 infection, and the 
        potential relevance of such infection to the disruption of 
        regular cognitive processes.
            (4) Studies on the relevance of psychological and 
        psychosocial factors, including major disruptions of physical 
        health, mental health, and economic stability associated with 
        the COVID-19 pandemic, on the disruption of regular cognitive 
        processes, including an identification and evaluation of such 
        factors.
            (5) Any other activities the Director determines will 
        support interdisciplinary research and collaboration on the 
        disruption of regular cognitive processes associated with 
        COVID-19 infection, including with respect to children and 
        adolescents.

SEC. 5. NATIONAL ACADEMIES STUDY ON THE DISRUPTION OF COGNITIVE 
              PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH COVID-19 INFECTION.

    (a) Study.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 45 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Director shall enter into an 
        agreement with the National Academies to study and produce a 
        report on the disruption of cognitive processes associated with 
        COVID-19 infection. The study shall--
                    (A) review the research literature and identify 
                research gaps regarding Federal programs and activities 
                with roles in addressing both short-term and long-term 
                consequences associated with COVID-19 infection;
                    (B) assess the necessity of establishing causal 
                inference approaches into research on the impacts of 
                COVID-19 infection on cognitive processes to determine 
                reverse causation;
                    (C) evaluate and make recommendations regarding the 
                coordination of research and data collection, including 
                with respect to children and adolescents, to identify 
                the disruption of regular cognitive processes 
                associated with COVID-19 infection, including long-term 
                COVID-19;
                    (D) evaluate impacts of COVID-19 infection on 
                populations under-represented in cognitive literature, 
                such as poor, rural, and minority populations; and
                    (E) make recommendations regarding ways to 
                coordinate engagement with researchers and stakeholders 
                from universities, industry, public health 
                organizations, State and local governments, elementary 
                and secondary educational organizations, and non-profit 
                organizations to ensure that research, information, and 
                best practices relating to the disruption of regular 
                cognitive processes associated with COVID-19 infection, 
                including long-term COVID-19, are shared among such 
                entities.
            (2) Completion.--The study required under paragraph (1) 
        shall be completed by not later than the date that is 16 months 
        after the date of the enactment of this Act.
    (b) Reports.--
            (1) By the national academies.--Upon completion of the 
        study under subsection (a), the National Academies shall 
        transmit to the Director and Congress a report on such study.
            (2) By the director.--Not later than three months after 
        receipt of the report under paragraph (1), the Director shall 
        transmit to Congress a summary of the Director's plans, if any, 
        to implement the recommendations of the National Academies 
        contained in such report.

SEC. 6. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.

    There is authorized to be appropriated to the Director to carry out 
this Act $10,000,000 for fiscal year 2023, to remain available through 
fiscal year 2025, of which $1,000,000 is authorized to carry out the 
study and produce the reports under section 5.
