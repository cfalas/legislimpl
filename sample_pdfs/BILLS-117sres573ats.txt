                               RESOLUTION


 
     To authorize testimony and representation in United States v. 
                           Robertson, et al.

Whereas, in the case of United States v. Robertson, et al., Cr. No. 21-34, 
        pending in the United States District Court for the District of 
        Columbia, the prosecution has requested the production of testimony from 
        Daniel Schwager, a former employee of the Office of the Secretary of the 
        Senate, and from Nate Russell and Diego Torres, custodians of records in 
        the Senate Recording Studio, a department of the Office of the Sergeant 
        at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate;
Whereas, pursuant to sections 703(a) and 704(a)(2) of the Ethics in Government 
        Act of 1978, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 288b(a) and 288c(a)(2), the Senate may 
        direct its counsel to represent current and former officers and 
        employees of the Senate with respect to any subpoena, order, or request 
        for evidence relating to their official responsibilities;
Whereas, by the privileges of the Senate of the United States and Rule XI of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, no evidence under the control or in the 
        possession of the Senate may, by the judicial or administrative process, 
        be taken from such control or possession but by permission of the 
        Senate; and
Whereas, when it appears that evidence under the control or in the possession of 
        the Senate may promote the administration of justice, the Senate will 
        take such action as will promote the ends of justice consistent with the 
        privileges of the Senate: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That Daniel Schwager, a former employee of the Office of 
the Secretary of the Senate, and Nate Russell and Diego Torres, 
custodians of records in the Senate Recording Studio, are authorized to 
provide relevant testimony in the case of United States v. Robertson, 
et al., except concerning matters for which a privilege should be 
asserted.
    Sec. 2.  The Senate Legal Counsel is authorized to represent 
Messrs. Schwager, Russell, and Torres, and any current or former 
officer or employee of their offices, in connection with the production 
of evidence authorized in section one of this resolution.
