        State may not provide to an individual an absentee ballot to 
        vote in an election for Federal office unless such individual

                    ``(B) The individual is unable to vote in person on 
                the date of the election because such individual 
                provides care to a parent, spouse, or child with an 
                illness, disability, or injury that requires constant 
                care.
                    ``(C) The individual suffers from a physical 
                ailment, or is an individual with a disability, that 
                substantially limits the ability of the individual to 
                vote in person.
                    ``(D) The individual will be absent from the 
                jurisdiction in which the individual is registered to 
                vote on the date of the election.
                    ``(E) The individual is entitled to vote by 
                absentee ballot under any other Federal law.
            ``(2) Application requirements.--A State may not provide to 
        an individual an absentee ballot to vote in an election for 
        Federal office unless--

                application is received by the official not later than 
                noon on the Friday before the date of the election; and
                    ``(B) the application includes--

                            ``(ii) the reason such individual is unable 
                        to vote in person at the appropriate polling 
                        place in the State on the date of the election 
                        and such reason is an excusable reason 
                        described in paragraph (1); and
                            ``(iii) a sworn written statement attesting

each election for Federal office held after the date of the enactment 
of this section.''.
