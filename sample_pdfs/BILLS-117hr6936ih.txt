animal populations, and cause detrimental economic damage to local 
communities.
    (b) Semipostal.--In order to afford a convenient way for members of 
the public to contribute to programs at the Department of the Interior 
and the Department of Agriculture that combat invasive species, the 
United States Postal Service shall issue a semipostal stamp in 
accordance with the provisions of this section. Such semipostal stamp 
shall be known as the ``Combating Invasive Species Semipostal Stamp''.
    (c) Terms and Conditions.--
            (1) In general.--The issuance and sale of the Combating 
        Invasive Species Semipostal Stamp shall be governed by the 
        provisions of section 416 of title 39, United States Code, and 
        regulations issued under such section, subject to the 
        requirements of this subsection.
            (2) Differential rate.--The differential included in the 
        rate of postage established for the Combating Invasive Species 
        Semipostal Stamp under section 416(c) of such title may not 
        exceed 25 percent.
            (3) Duration.--The Combating Invasive Species Semipostal 
        Stamp shall be made available to the public for a period of 2 
        years, beginning not later than 12 months after the date of 
        enactment of this Act.
            (4) Disposition of proceeds.--All amounts becoming 
        available from the sale of the Combating Invasive Species 
        Semipostal Stamp (as determined under section 416(d) of such 
        title) shall be transferred in equal proportion to the 
        Department of the Interior and the Department of Agriculture, 
        for the programs described in subsection (b), through payments 
        which shall be made at least twice a year.
    (d) Definition.--For purposes of this Act, the term ``semipostal 
stamp'' means a stamp described in section 416(a)(1) of such title.
