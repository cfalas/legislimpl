_______________________________________________________________________

                                 A BILL


 
     To require SelectUSA to coordinate with State-level economic 
  development organizations to increase foreign direct investment in 
          semiconductor-related manufacturing and production.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Securing Semiconductor Supply Chains 
Act of 2022''.

SEC. 2. SELECTUSA DEFINED.

    In this Act, the term ``SelectUSA'' means the SelectUSA program of 
the Department of Commerce established by Executive Order 13577 (76 
Fed. Reg. 35,715).

SEC. 3. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Semiconductors underpin the United States and global 
        economies, including manufacturing sectors. Semiconductors are 
        also essential to the national security of the United States.
            (2) A shortage of semiconductors, brought about by the 
        COVID-19 pandemic and other complex factors impacting the 
        overall supply chain, has threatened the economic recovery of 
        the United States and industries that employ millions of United 
        States citizens.
            (3) Addressing current challenges and building resilience 
        against future risks requires ensuring a secure and stable 
        supply chain for semiconductors that will support the economic 
        and national security needs of the United States and its 
        allies.
            (4) The supply chain for semiconductors is complex and 
        global. While the United States plays a leading role in certain 
        segments of the semiconductor industry, securing the supply 
        chain requires onshoring, reshoring, or diversifying vulnerable 
        segments, such as for--
                    (A) fabrication;
                    (B) advanced packaging; and
                    (C) materials and equipment used to manufacture 
                semiconductor products.
            (5) The Federal Government can leverage foreign direct 
        investment and private dollars to grow the domestic 
        manufacturing and production capacity of the United States for 
        vulnerable segments of the semiconductor supply chain.
            (6) The SelectUSA program of the Department of Commerce, in 
        coordination with other Federal agencies and State-level 
        economic development organizations, is positioned to boost 
        foreign direct investment in domestic manufacturing and to help 
        secure the semiconductor supply chain of the United States.

SEC. 4. COORDINATION WITH STATE-LEVEL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT 
              ORGANIZATIONS.

    Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this 
Act, the Executive Director of SelectUSA shall solicit comments from 
State-level economic development organizations--
            (1) to review--
                    (A) what efforts the Federal Government can take to 
                support increased foreign direct investment in any 
                segment of semiconductor-related production;
                    (B) what barriers to such investment may exist and 
                how to amplify State efforts to attract such 
                investment;
                    (C) public opportunities those organizations have 
                identified to attract foreign direct investment to help 
                increase investment described in subparagraph (A); and
                    (D) resource gaps or other challenges that prevent 
                those organizations from increasing such investment; 
                and
            (2) to develop recommendations for--
                    (A) how SelectUSA can increase such investment 
                independently or through partnership with those 
                organizations; and
                    (B) working with countries that are allies or 
                partners of the United States to ensure that foreign 
                adversaries (as defined in section 8(c)(2) of the 
                Secure and Trusted Communications Networks Act of 2019 
                (47 U.S.C. 1607(c)(2))) do not benefit from United 
                States efforts to increase such investment.

SEC. 5. REPORT ON INCREASING FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT IN 
              SEMICONDUCTOR-RELATED MANUFACTURING AND PRODUCTION.

    Not later than 2 years after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
the Executive Director of SelectUSA, in coordination with the Federal 
Interagency Investment Working Group established by Executive Order 
13577 (76 Fed. Reg. 35,715; relating to establishment of the SelectUSA 
Initiative), shall submit to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and 
Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Energy and Commerce 
of the House of Representatives a report that includes--
            (1) a review of the comments SelectUSA received from State-
        level economic development organizations under section 4;
            (2) a description of activities SelectUSA is engaged in to 
        increase foreign direct investment in semiconductor-related 
        manufacturing and production; and
            (3) an assessment of strategies SelectUSA may implement to 
        achieve an increase in such investment and to help secure the 
        United States supply chain for semiconductors, including by--
                    (A) working with other relevant Federal agencies; 
                and
                    (B) working with State-level economic development 
                organizations and implementing any strategies or 
                recommendations SelectUSA received from those 
                organizations.
