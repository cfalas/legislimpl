SEC. 2. WITHDRAWALS FOR CERTAIN EMERGENCY EXPENSES.

    (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 72(t) of the Internal 
Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following new 
subparagraph:
                    ``(I) Distributions for certain emergency 
                expenses.--
                            ``(i) In general.--Any emergency personal 
                        expense distribution.

                        distribution per calendar year may be treated 
                        as an emergency personal expense distribution 
                        by any individual.
                            ``(iii) Dollar limitation.--The amount 
                        which may be treated as an emergency personal

                        calendar year shall not exceed the lesser of

                                as of the date of each such

                        distribution.--For purposes of this 
                        subparagraph, the term `emergency personal 
                        expense distribution' means any distribution 
                        from an applicable eligible retirement plan (as 
                        defined in subparagraph (H)(vi)(I)) to an 
                        individual for purposes of meeting 
                        unforeseeable or immediate financial needs 
                        relating to necessary personal or family 
                        emergency expenses. The administrator of an 
                        applicable eligible retirement plan may rely on 
                        an employee's certification that the employee 
                        satisfies the conditions of the preceding 
                        sentence in determining whether any

                        regard to clause (iii)) be an emergency 
                        personal expense distribution, a plan shall not 
                        be treated as failing to meet any requirement 
                        of this title merely because the plan treats 
                        the distribution as an emergency personal 
                        expense distribution, unless the aggregate
