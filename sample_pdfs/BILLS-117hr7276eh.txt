                                 AN ACT


 
To direct the President to submit to Congress a report on United States 
   Government efforts to collect, analyze, and preserve evidence and 
information related to war crimes and other atrocities committed during 
the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine since February 24, 2022, and 
                          for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Ukraine Invasion War Crimes 
Deterrence and Accountability Act''.

SEC. 2. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) in its premeditated, unprovoked, unjustified, and 
        unlawful full-scale invasion of Ukraine that commenced on 
        February 24, 2022, the military of the Government of the 
        Russian Federation under the direction of President Vladimir 
        Putin has committed war crimes that include but are not limited 
        to--
                    (A) the deliberate targeting of civilians and 
                injuring or killing of noncombatants;
                    (B) the deliberate targeting and attacking of 
                hospitals, schools, and other non-military buildings 
                dedicated to religion, art, science, or charitable 
                purposes, such as the bombing of a theater in Mariupol 
                that served as a shelter for noncombatants and had the 
                word ``children'' written clearly in the Russian 
                language outside;
                    (C) the indiscriminate bombardment of undefended 
                dwellings and buildings;
                    (D) the wanton destruction of property not 
                justified by military necessity;
                    (E) unlawful civilian deportations;
                    (F) the taking of hostages; and
                    (G) rape, or sexual assault or abuse;
            (2) the use of chemical weapons by the Government of the 
        Russian Federation in Ukraine would constitute a war crime, and 
        engaging in any military preparations to use chemical weapons 
        or to develop, produce, stockpile, or retain chemical weapons 
        is prohibited by the Chemical Weapons Convention, to which the 
        Russian Federation is a signatory;
            (3) Vladimir Putin has a long record of committing acts of 
        aggression, systematic abuses of human rights, and acts that 
        constitute war crimes or other atrocities both at home and 
        abroad, and the brutality and scale of these actions, including 
        in the Russian Federation republic of Chechnya, Georgia, Syria, 
        and Ukraine, demonstrate the extent to which his regime is 
        willing to flout international norms and values in the pursuit 
        of its objectives;
            (4) Vladimir Putin has previously sanctioned the use of 
        chemical weapons at home and abroad, including in the 
        poisonings of Russian spy turned double agent Sergei Skripal 
        and his daughter Yulia and leading Russian opposition figure 
        Aleksey Navalny, and aided and abetted the use of chemical 
        weapons by President Bashar al-Assad in Syria; and
            (5) in 2014, the Government of the Russian Federation 
        initiated its unprovoked war of aggression against Ukraine 
        which resulted in its illegal occupation of Crimea, the 
        unrecognized declaration of independence by the so-called 
        ``Donetsk People's Republic'' and ``Luhansk People's Republic'' 
        by Russia-backed proxies, and numerous human rights violations 
        and deaths of civilians in Ukraine.

SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.

    It is the policy of the United States--
            (1) to collect, analyze, and preserve evidence and 
        information related to war crimes and other atrocities 
        committed during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine 
        that began on February 24, 2022, for use in appropriate 
        domestic, foreign, and international courts and tribunals 
        prosecuting those responsible for such crimes;
            (2) to help deter the commission of war crimes and other 
        atrocities in Ukraine by publicizing to the maximum possible 
        extent, including among Russian and other foreign military 
        commanders and troops in Ukraine, efforts to identify and 
        prosecute those responsible for the commission of war crimes 
        during the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine that began on 
        February 24, 2022; and
            (3) to continue efforts to identify, deter, and pursue 
        accountability for war crimes and other atrocities committed 
        around the world and by other perpetrators, and to leverage 
        international cooperation and best practices in this regard 
        with respect to the current situation in Ukraine.

SEC. 4. REPORT ON UNITED STATES EFFORTS.

    Not later than 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act, 
and consistent with the protection of intelligence sources and methods,

                being collected, analyzed, and preserved to help 
                identify those responsible for the commission of war 
                crimes or other atrocities during the full-scale 
                Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022; and
                    (C) steps taken to coordinate with, and support the 
                work of, allies, partners, international institutions 
                and organizations, and nongovernmental organizations in 
                such efforts.
            (2) Media, public diplomacy, and information operations to 
        make Russian military commanders, troops, political leaders and 
        the Russian people aware of efforts to identify and prosecute 
        those responsible for the commission of war crimes or other
