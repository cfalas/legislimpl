                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives regarding the 
consideration of ``Just War'' principles prior to any vote with respect 
  to a declaration of war or an authorization of the use of military 
                                 force.

Whereas the incorporation of ``Just War'' principles into deliberations with 
        regard to a declaration of war or an authorization of the use of 
        military force will ensure that the United States takes military action 
        only under certain circumstances: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of Representatives 
that, prior to any vote by the House with respect to the introduction 
of the United States Armed Forces into hostilities, or into situations 
where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the 
circumstances, the House should also determine--
            (1) whether such introduction is for the purpose of a just 
        cause, such as--
                    (A) stopping a genocide or ethnic cleansing;
                    (B) stopping grievous, massive, and irreparable 
                harm to the environment; or
                    (C) protecting the United States or its allies from 
                invasion or mass destruction;
            (2) whether the proposed action will be--
                    (A) in response only to the underlying just cause;
                    (B) proportional to the underlying just cause; and
                    (C) undertaken with the intent to reestablish 
                peace;
            (3) whether the presumed benefits of the proposed action 
        outweigh the harm done;
            (4) whether there is a reasonable probability that the 
        proposed action will succeed; and
            (5) whether all alternatives to military action have been 
        exhausted.
