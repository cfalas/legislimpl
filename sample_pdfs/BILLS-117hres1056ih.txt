 Supporting the designation of April 10 as ``Dolores Huerta Day'', in 
       honor of the accomplishments and legacy of Dolores Huerta.

Whereas Dolores Huerta was born on April 10, 1930, in Dawson, New Mexico;
Whereas Dolores Huerta began her activism career in 1955 when she cofounded the 
        Stockton, California, chapter of the Community Services Organization, 
        which worked to improve voting access and economic conditions for 
        Latinos;
Whereas, with her coorganizer Cesar Chavez, Dolores Huerta founded the National 
        Farm Workers Association, a forerunner to United Farm Workers, in 1962;
Whereas Dolores Huerta helped organize the Delano grape worker strike in 1965 
        and was the lead negotiator in developing the ensuing contract;
Whereas Dolores Huerta was instrumental in the enactment of the California 
        Agricultural Labor Relations Act of 1975, the first law in the United 
        States that allowed farm workers to collectively organize and bargain;
Whereas Dolores Huerta has worked tirelessly to create safer working conditions 
        for farm workers, including eliminating harmful pesticides;
Whereas Dolores Huerta served as the voice for feminism and women's equality 
        within the farm workers movement;
Whereas Dolores Huerta originated the phrase ``Si Se Puede'', which became a 
        rallying cry for the farm workers movement and against injustice;
Whereas Dolores Huerta remained committed to her principles of nonviolence, even 
        when faced with violence at the hands of police and growers;
Whereas Dolores Huerta worked in the latter part of her career to elect more 
        Latinos and women to political office, and has been a champion for 
        women's rights;
Whereas, in 2003, Dolores Huerta founded the Dolores Huerta Foundation to 
        continue her legacy of fighting for equality and civil rights, and is 
        currently the president of this foundation;
Whereas Dolores Huerta has received numerous awards, including the Eleanor 
        Roosevelt Human Rights Award and the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the 
        highest civilian honor; and
Whereas the United States should continue the efforts of Dolores Huerta to 
        ensure equal protection under the law and civil rights for all people of 
        the United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) supports the designation of ``Dolores Huerta Day''; and
            (2) honors Dolores Huerta's contributions to advancing 
        civil rights and equality.
