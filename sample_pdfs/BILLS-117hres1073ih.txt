                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing support for the goals and ideals of National Child Abuse 
                           Prevention Month.

Whereas children are fundamental to the success of our Nation and will shape the 
        future of the United States;
Whereas elected representatives and leaders in our communities must be ever 
        vigilant and proactive in support of evidence-based means to prevent 
        child abuse;
Whereas economic adversity has been observed as a precursor to harsh parenting 
        and increased risk for potential abuse of children;
Whereas, in 2020, an estimated 7,100,000 children were referred to Child 
        Protective Services (CPS) agencies, alleging maltreatment;
Whereas, in 2020, there was an alarming increase in reports alleging 
        maltreatment by children themselves to crisis hotlines;
Whereas, in 2020, most children did not attend school in-person due to the 
        COVID-19 pandemic, making it difficult for the largest group of child 
        abuse reporters, education personnel, to observe and report suspected 
        maltreatment;
Whereas the mental, physical, and economic stress of the COVID-19 pandemic has 
        resulted in a heightened risk of child abuse;
Whereas 2020 saw more than 21,700,000 reports of suspected child sexual 
        exploitation made to the National Center for Missing and Exploited 
        Children's CyberTipline, which marked the highest number of reports ever 
        received in 1 year;
Whereas reports indicate that 1 in 10 children faces sexual abuse before their 
        18th birthday;
Whereas approximately 1 in 7 children in the United States has experienced child 
        abuse, neglect, or both during the past year;
Whereas 1 in 5 children has received a sexual approach or solicitation on the 
        internet during the past year;
Whereas 93 percent of juvenile sexual assault victims know their abuser;
Whereas children who are sexually abused, when not provided appropriate 
        treatment, often suffer from lifelong problems, such as physical and 
        mental health issues, drug and alcohol abuse, and suicide;
Whereas children who are abused or neglected are more likely to be arrested for 
        delinquent behavior as juveniles;
Whereas children who have experienced abuse are more likely to be arrested for 
        violent and criminal behavior as adults;
Whereas child abuse and neglect cost the Nation over $1,000,000,000 a year;
Whereas education and awareness of possible signs of child abuse should be 
        prioritized for purposes of prevention;
Whereas Keep Kids Safe is a survivor-centered movement of organizations 
        dedicated to preventing sexual violence against children and 
        adolescents, and to healing and justice for survivors;
Whereas this movement includes the Monique Burr Foundation, Darkness to Light, 
        Prevent Child Abuse America, Together for Girls, the SNAP network, the 
        Army of Survivors, and the National Children's Alliance; and
Whereas these organizations play a critical role in preventing childhood sexual 
        abuse and helping survivors heal and seek justice: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
            (1) expresses support for the goals and ideals of National 
        Child Abuse Prevention Month;
            (2) supports efforts to increase the awareness of, and 
        provide education for, the general public of the United States, 
        related to the prevention of childhood sexual abuse;
            (3) supports the efforts to help survivors of childhood 
        sexual abuse heal;
            (4) supports justice for victims of childhood sexual abuse; 
        and
            (5) recognizes the need for additional resources and 
        Federal legislation for prevention, healing, and justice 
        efforts related to childhood sexual abuse.
