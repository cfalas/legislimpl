                               RESOLUTION


 
   Recognizing the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities 
National Internship Program on the 30th anniversary of the program and 
     celebrating its legacy of increasing diversity in the Federal 
                   Government and the private sector.

Whereas 2022 marks the 30th anniversary of the Hispanic Association of Colleges 
        and Universities National Internship Program (referred to in this 
        preamble as ``HNIP'');
Whereas the HNIP began with 24 interns in the summer of 1992 and has grown to a 
        year-round internship program for Hispanic and underrepresented 
        students, placing over 500 interns every year in multiple Federal 
        agencies;
Whereas, in 2020, the Hispanic population accounted for 62,100,000, or 18.7 
        percent, of the total United States population;
Whereas, according to the Annual Report to the President on Hispanic Employment 
        in the Federal Government for Fiscal Year 2018 by the Office of 
        Personnel Management, only 9.1 percent of Federal employees were 
        Hispanic and only 3.3 percent were in Senior Executive Service 
        positions;
Whereas the HNIP has been cited in the Hispanic Nine Point Plan by the Office of 
        Personnel Management as a resource to increase the recruitment of 
        Hispanic interns in the Federal Government; and
Whereas the HNIP has produced over 14,000 alumni who are now in the Federal 
        Government, State or local government, and private industry: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) recognizes the Hispanic Association of Colleges and 
        Universities National Internship Program (referred to in this 
        resolving clause as ``HNIP'') for 30 years of providing 
        internship opportunities to Hispanic and underrepresented 
        students attending Hispanic-serving institutions and other 
        institutions of higher education;
            (2) congratulates all HNIP alumni who continue to make a 
        difference in the communities of the United States; and
            (3) encourages the Hispanic Association of Colleges and 
        Universities to continue to support and inspire future Hispanic 
        and underrepresented leaders.
