       Commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Weather Channel.

Whereas since its launch on May 2, 1982, the Weather Channel has helped save 
        countless lives by reaching millions of viewers and preparing them for 
        severe weather events across the country through its live coverage and 
        dedicated, indepth reporting;

        which enabled the distribution of important localized weather 
        information across the United States;
Whereas, in 1995, the Weather Channel launched weather.com, the first wireless 
        weather content online, to reach more Americans and prepare them for 
        severe weather events;
Whereas, in 2003, the Weather Channel launched the HIRAD system, which 
        dramatically increased the accuracy of weather condition information and

        conditions;
Whereas, in 2006, the Weather Channel won an Emmy for advancements in its STAR 
        technology;
Whereas, in 2012, the Weather Channel became the first organization in the 
        United States to give names to winter storms, making it easier to 
        communicate these weather events to a national audience;

        tornadoes using immersive mixed reality storytelling;

        Brand of the Year'' for the 11th consecutive year;
Whereas the Weather Channel covered countless catastrophic severe weather 
        events, such as Hurricanes Katrina and Harvey and the Joplin tornado, to 
        help keep Americans informed and safe as these storms affected their 
        towns;
Whereas over the years, the Weather Channel has consistently ranked among 
        America's most loved and trusted news brands;
Whereas, in April 2022, the Weather Channel launched a direct-to-consumer TV app 
        that delivered an enhanced viewing experience and made its vital 
        programming more accessible; and
Whereas today, the Weather Channel launched the Weather Channel en Espanol in an 
        effort to bring important weather information to more Americans: Now, 
        therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the House of Representatives--
