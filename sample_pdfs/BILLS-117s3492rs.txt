                                 A BILL


 
   To address the importance of foreign affairs training to national 
                   security, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

&lt;DELETED&gt;SECTION 1. SENSE OF CONGRESS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    It is the sense of Congress that--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the Department of State is a crucial national 
        security agency, whose employees, both Foreign Service and 
        Civil Service, require the best possible training at every 
        stage of their careers to prepare them to promote and defend 
        United States national interests and the health and safety of 
        United States citizens abroad;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the investment of time and resources by the 
        Department with respect to the training and education of its 
        personnel is considerably below the level of other Federal 
        departments and agencies in the national security field, and 
        falls well below the investments many allied and adversarial 
        countries make in the development of their diplomats;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the Department faces increasingly complex and 
        rapidly evolving challenges, many of which are science and 
        technology-driven, and which demand continual, high-quality 
        training and education of its personnel;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) the Department must move beyond reliance on 
        ``on-the-job training'' and other informal mentorship 
        practices, which lead to an inequality in skillset development 
        and career advancement opportunities, often particularly for 
        minority personnel, and toward a robust professional tradecraft 
        training continuum that will provide for greater equality in 
        career advancement;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (5) the Department must clearly link training to 
        promotional opportunities, requiring officers to take certain 
        classes at institutions of the Department (or equivalent 
        courses at other institutions) at specific phases throughout 
        their careers and to participate in fellowship programs that 
        expose diplomats to other agencies, organizations, and 
        cultures;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (6) the Foreign Service Institute and other 
        training facilities of the Department should seek to increase 
        substantially educational and training offerings to Department 
        personnel, including by developing new and innovative education 
        and training courses, methods, programs, and opportunities; 
        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (7) consistent with gift acceptance authority of 
        the Department and other applicable laws in effect as of the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the Department and the 
        Foreign Service Institute should accept funds and other 
        resources from foundations, not-for-profit corporations, and 
        other appropriate sources to help the Department and the 
        Institute enhance the quantity and quality of training 
        offerings, especially in the introduction of new, innovative, 
        and pilot model courses.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 2. DEFINITION OF APPROPRIATE CONGRESSIONAL 
              COMMITTEES.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    In this Act, the term ``appropriate congressional 
committees'' means--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) the Committee on Foreign Relations and the 
        Committee on Appropriations of the Senate; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the 
        Committee on Appropriations of the House of 
        Representatives.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 3. TRAINING FLOAT STRATEGY.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of 
the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall develop and 
submit to the appropriate congressional committees a strategy to 
establish a ``training float'' to allow for a minimum of 10 percent and 
up to 15 percent of officers of the Civil Service of the Department of 
State and the Foreign Service to participate in long-term training at 
any given time.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (b) Identification of Steps.--The strategy required by 
subsection (a) shall identify steps necessary to ensure--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) implementation of the training priorities 
        described in section 4;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) sufficient training capacity and opportunities 
        are available to Civil Service and Foreign Service 
        officers;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) the use of mechanisms to ensure equitable 
        distribution of long-term training opportunities to Civil 
        Service and Foreign Service officers; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) the availability of resources and any 
        additional authorities necessary to facilitate the training 
        float described in subsection (a), including through programs 
        at the Foreign Service Institute, the Foreign Affairs Security 
        Training Center, and other facilities or programs operated by 
        the Department.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (c) Identification of Training.--The strategy required by 
subsection (a) shall identify--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) which types of training would be prioritized 
        under the training float;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) the extent to which such training is already 
        being provided to Civil Service and Foreign Service officers by 
        the Department;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) any factors in existence as of the date on 
        which the strategy is submitted that incentivize or 
        disincentive such training; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (4) why such training cannot be achieved without 
        Foreign Service officers leaving the workforce.&lt;/DELETED&gt;
&lt;DELETED&gt;    (d) Considerations.--In developing the strategy required 
by subsection (a), the Secretary of State shall consider, in addition 
to training opportunities provided by the Department, training that 
could be provided by other United States Government training 
institutions and nongovernmental educational institutions.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 4. TRAINING PRIORITIZATION.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    In order to provide the Civil Service of the Department of 
State and the Foreign Service with the level of education and training 
needed to effectively advance United States interests across the world, 
the Secretary of State shall--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) increase offerings provided by the 
        Department--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) of interactive virtual instruction to 
                make training more accessible and useful to personnel 
                deployed throughout the world; or&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) at partner organizations, including 
                universities, industry entities, and nongovernmental 
                organizations, throughout the United States to provide 
                useful outside perspectives to Department personnel to 
                provide such personnel--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (i) a more comprehensive outlook 
                        on different sectors of United States society; 
                        and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (ii) practical experience dealing 
                        with commercial corporations, universities, 
                        labor unions, and other institutions critical 
                        to United States diplomatic success;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) offer courses using computer-based or 
        computer-assisted simulations, allowing civilian officers to 
        lead decision making in a crisis environment, and encourage 
        officers of the Department of State and reciprocally officers 
        of other Departments to participate in similar exercises held 
        by the Department of State or other government organizations 
        and the private sector; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (3) increase the duration and expand the focus of 
        certain training courses, including by--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) extending the A-100 entry-level course 
                to not less than 12 weeks, better matching the length 
                of entry-level training provided to the officers in 
                other national security departments and agencies; 
                and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) extending the chief of mission course 
                to not less than 6 weeks for first time chiefs of 
                mission and creating a comparable 6-week course for new 
                Assistant Secretaries and Deputy Assistant Secretaries 
                to more accurately reflect the significant 
                responsibilities accompanying such roles.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;SEC. 5. FELLOWSHIPS.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

&lt;DELETED&gt;    The Director General of the Foreign Service shall--
&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (1) establish new fellowship programs for Foreign 
        Service and Civil Service officers that include short- and 
        long-term opportunities at organizations including--&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (A) think tanks and nongovernmental 
                organizations;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (B) the Department of Defense, the

                section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 
                U.S.C. 3003)), and other relevant Federal 
                agencies;&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (C) industry entities, especially such 
                entities related to technology, global operations, 
                finance, and other fields directly relevant to 
                international affairs; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
                &lt;DELETED&gt;    (D) schools of international relations and 
                other relevant programs at universities throughout the 
                United States; and&lt;/DELETED&gt;
        &lt;DELETED&gt;    (2) expand the Pearson Fellows Program for Foreign 
        Service Officers and the Brookings Fellow Program for Civil 
        Servants at the Department of State to allow fellows in those 
        programs the opportunity to undertake a follow-on assignment 
        within the Department in an office that will benefit from 
        practical knowledge of the people and processes of 
        Congress.&lt;/DELETED&gt;

        driven, and which demand continual, high-quality training and 
        professional development of its personnel;
            (3) the new and evolving challenges of national security in 
        the 21st century necessitates the expansion of standardized 
        training and professional development opportunities linked to 
        equitable, accountable, and transparent promotion and 
        leadership practices for Department of State and other national 
        security agency personnel; and
