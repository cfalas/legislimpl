        proven to be environmentally responsible; and
            (2) increasing the safe transmission of natural gas will 
        lead to more reliable, abundant, and cleaner domestic supplies 
        of energy that will contribute to job growth and economic 
        development.

SEC. 104. NATURAL GAS EXPORTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (1) increasing clean and safe natural gas exports will lead 
        to increased investment and development of domestic supplies of 
        natural gas that will contribute to job growth and economic 
        development; and
            (2) the export of clean and safe natural gas to other 
        nations is of vital national interest to the United States.
    (b) Natural Gas Exports.--Section 3(c) of the Natural Gas Act (15 
U.S.C. 717b(c)) is amended--
            (1) by inserting ``or any other nation not excluded by this 
        section'' after ``trade in natural gas'';
            (2) by inserting ``and in any event by not later than 60 
        days after the date on which the application is received'' 
        before the period at the end;
            (3) by striking ``(c) For purposes'' and inserting the 
        following:
    ``(c) Expedited Application and Approval Process.--
            ``(1) In general.--For purposes''; and

                President or Congress may designate nations that may be 
                excluded from expedited approval under paragraph (1)

in a State described in that subsection, the Secretary shall offer all 
parcels eligible for oil and gas development under the resource 
management plan in effect for the State.

subsection (a) for a calendar year is canceled, delayed, or deferred, 
including for a lack of eligible parcels, the Secretary shall conduct a
